Rwanda’s Finance Minister, Uzziel Ndagijimana, on Monday asked parliament to raise the government’s spending for the financial year to June by 4.8 per cent. The East African economy, which is mainly dependent on farming and services like hospitality, grew by an average of 10.9 per cent in the first nine months of last year, Ndagijimana said. The government’s motion is almost certain to pass through parliament where President Paul Kagame’s ruling party has full control. According to Reuters, the additional expenditure would increase the government’s spending to 3.02 trillion francs ($3.29 billion), with the extra cash funding the hiring of new doctors and other government programs, the minister said. He said the extra cash would be raised through tax revenues and other non-tax revenues, without providing more details.
