 The Niger Delta militants had a clear cause which was the fulcrum of their struggles. Their region produced the wealth of the nation but the structural lopsidedness and sinister nature of the Nigerian state made it impossible for them to enjoy the benefits of the black gold. They vandalized pipelines, abducted Caucasian workers and took up arms against the state to protest their plight. Their strategy worked as the administration of the late Umaru Musa Yar’Adua granted a majority of them amnesty which helped to calm their frayed nerves. Some of them were sent to learn courses that will make them relevant in the oil and gas sector in European and Asian countries while the rest were trained locally and in South Africa. Their reintegration into the society made a whole lot of sense as they were rebels with a cause and this helped to bring peace to the troubled Niger Delta region. The recent release of 1400 Boko Haram members from a prison in Borno by the federal government was clearly in bad taste as the circumstances were clearly different from that of the Niger Delta militants. The latter were agitating for a known cause while the former are nothing but blood thirsty elements whose only mission is to spread terror. Many soldiers reportedly weren’t in support of it as it made a huge mockery of their efforts in curtailing the menace. Their release is highly demoralizing as it makes their efforts in wiping out the scourge futile. Think of the sacrifice these brave soldiers make for our dear country to be safe. Many complain that they are paid a pittance which explains why some of them even deserted their duty posts as they couldn’t match the sophisticated weapons of warfare of their adversary. The government should have zero tolerance for terrorism and should never in any circumstances negotiate with them as they are worse than emotional blackmailers who will stop at nothing to wreck more havoc.
