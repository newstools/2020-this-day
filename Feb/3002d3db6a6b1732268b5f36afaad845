By Raheem Akingbolu Heineken has announced its activities for 2020, offering its consumers premium lifestyle experiences. The announcement was made at a media event hosted recently, where for the first time, members of the public got the chance to take a tour of the upgraded Heineken House. In attendance were celebrities, journalists and other personalities from various industries. The event offered the brand the opportunity to reveal the new Heineken House as a premium membership club which would be the centre of Heineken activities for everyone looking to feel the Heineken premium experience. The brand also unveiled some of its exciting plans for the year, including the new James Bond, “No Time to Die” Movie premiere, as well as plans for Euro 2020. Also on the roster of activities is the UEFA Champions League, Formula 1 and the fashion season, which is set to see the brand throw its weight behind platforms such as the Lagos Fashion Week and Design Fashion Africa. Speaking at the launch event, Sarah Agha, Portfolio Manager – International Premium Brands, Nigerian Breweries, Ltd., spoke on what to expect over the next 10 months. She said: “Every year, Heineken sets the bar for unique, unforgettable consumer-facing campaigns. This year, we have no plans to rest on our laurels. Last year, we brought the Legend, Carles Puyol, as part of our Unmissable campaign and we delighted fans with a 3-day Champions League trophy tour. Our efforts across various industries also saw us sponsor the Design Fashion Africa platform as well as the Lagos Fashion Week. “In 2019, we also sponsored the prestigious Lagos Open tournament. However, all of those are just the tip of the iceberg. This year, we are extending our brand footprint across even more platforms. Kicking off with our customary sponsorship of the biggest sporting tournament in the world, the UEFA Champions League.”
