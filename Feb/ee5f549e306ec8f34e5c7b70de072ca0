 Ole Gunnar
Solskjaer says Odion Ighalo will travel with Manchester United for their game
against Chelsea, but did not confirm whether the on-loan striker will play
following his two-week ‘isolation’. The Nigerian
striker was kept away from the club’s AON Training Complex in Carrington amid
fears over spreading the coronavirus. The 30-year-old
has not tested positive for the virus and, as part of the
government’s precautionary procedures, was put on a two-week incubation period
ending this weekend – coinciding with United’s return to the UK from their
warm-weather training camp in Marbella, which Ighalo had missed over similar
concerns. He has been
training in Manchester’s Taekwondo Centre on the Etihad Campus since completing
his Deadline Day loan move and will be part of United’s travelling party at
Stamford Bridge. “I never said he
was going to be ready to play on Monday, he’ll be involved with us and he will
travel down with us,” Solskjaer said. “Now he’s out of
that two-week period, just a precaution we made, let’s see if he’s involved or
not. “We’ve kept in
touch with him and of course we’ve done our own programme, he’s done
his, and it was always gonna be a case of him having to integrate having been
out in China and needs to get used to the players, and the team, up to speed as
quick as he can, he’s been working really hard. “When I first
arrived, it didn’t take me too long. I didn’t have a training session to come
on. As a striker you get thrown on out there and it might be he’ll have to come
off the bench and get us a goal.”
