 The second Intra-African Trade Fair (IATF2020) will provide key
pathways for the Rwandan private sector to access intra-African trade
opportunities offered by the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA),
Managing Director of Afreximbank’s Intra-African Trade Initiative, Kanayo
Awani,has said. Addressing the opening of a roadshow held in Kigali, recently, to
raise awareness about IATF2020 and to showcase Afreximbank products and
services, Awani said the way each country prepared for the operational phase of
the AfCFTA, which would commence on 1 July, would determine how successfully it
would benefit from the initiative. She said IATF2020 would provide strong business insight within
Africa by connecting buyers and sellers of goods and services across the
continent. As the host country of IATF2020, Rwanda and Rwandan businesses
would be the greatest beneficiaries of the trade fair, Awani said. “IATF2020, we believe, will transform the way Africans trade with
each other, and, specifically, the way Rwanda trades with other African
countries,” she said. CEO of Private Sector
Federation Rwanda, Stephen Ruzibiza, which co-organised the roadshow, said the
commencement of trade under the AfCFTA was a critical moment for Africa and
that the efforts to be deployed would determine success. “If we don’t put more emphasis now, then we may not realise the
benefits of the AfCFTA and intra-African trade,” he told the audience. The roadshow featured presentations of trade-enabling initiatives
and a comprehensive suite of products and facilities available from
Afreximbank. These included the Bank’s industrial parks projects; the Africa
Quality Assurance Centres, which aims to address challenges relating to
compliance with standards; the Centre of Excellence on health; the Afreximbank
Trade Facilitation Programme and other instruments seeking to address the lack
of access to finance by SMEs.
