The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) said it has registered over 2.1 million for the 2020 Unified Tertiary Matriculations Examination (UTME) and the Direct Entry, a record number in the 41-year history of the board. The board said in its weekly bulletin that while it registered 1,949,983 for the 2020 UTME, it registered 160,640 for the Direct Entry. The registration ended on February 17, with no extension of deadline. “A total number of 1,949,983 registered for UTME, while 160,640 registered for Direct Entry,” the board said. The examination body has also warned universities to desist from conducting admissions on their school portals, noting that such was a “flagrant abuse of the Central Admission Processing System.” “The CAPS is an automated platform for all institutions to conduct their admissions. This system engenders transparency, accountability and inclusiveness devoid of human interference. Institutions are the major actors with the sole authority to recommend candidates for admission while the board supervises by ensuring that all candidates are fairly, equitably and transparently treated. “Consequently, the conduct of admissions by institutions on their portals is a flagrant abuse of CAPS which is the only credible avenue for institutions to conduct admissions. “Any admission into the First Degree, National Certificate of Education, and others not on the official letterhead of the board or outside CAPS is null and void, it will not be condoned by JAMB. “Institutions are to note that admitting candidates outside CAPS will jeopardise candidates’ participation in the compulsory National Youth Service Corps mobilisation exercise or any job placement which requires the certification or endorsement of the board.”
