 The
Convention on Business Integrity/The Integrity Organisation in collaboration
with ActionAid, and other partners are set to hold the sixth series of their
regulatory conversations (RC6.0), with the theme: “National Identity Number: Matters Arising and Implications to Nation-building.” The event is expected to hold on March 5, in Lagos. Accordint
to a statement, though less than 20 per cent of the national population have
the NIN coupled with a struggling NIMC, the NIN was required to obtain the
country’s national passport, national driver’s license, registration for public
exams (JAMB), opening/maintain bank accounts, required to access retired
savings accounts (RSA) and so on. “The Regulatory Conversations (RCs) Series, which began in
September 2018, have provided a platform to interrogate Nigeria’s philosophy of
regulation and enabled stakeholders, including private sector actors, to
proffer solutions to observed gaps in the way and manner regulatory agencies have
been interpreting their mandates. “To date, five sessions of the RCs have held
addressing and proffering solutions to different issues. “The focus of the sixth Regulatory Conversations 6.0 would be on
the National Identity Number system, the efficiency or otherwise of the
operations and its implication for Nation building,” it explained. The forum is expected to provide a platform
for a robust discussion and anticipates having in attendance senior executives
from the government, companies, civil society and representatives of relevant
stakeholders. “This
forum would examine the key sectoral issues in the context of the following
viewpoints: The regulatory framework and the national identity system; the
implementation of regulation on the Mandatory Use of the National
Identification Number and their implications on the activities and business
transactions carried out by individuals and corporate entities in Nigeria; and
means of achieving the NIN without the levels of disruption, discomfort and
receipted payments allegedly involved,” it added.
