No fewer than 50 members of the Lagos Country Club are scheduled to participate in this year’s Inter Club Tournament against their Ibadan Club counterparts. The one-way tourney scheduled for today would see both clubs vie for honours in tennis, table-tennis, squash, scrabble, darts and some other sports. Lagos Country Club Sports Secretary, Segun Aluko expressed confidence in the Ikeja-based club to put up a memorable outing stating that the club will be on top of their game to justify the large number of activities at the various sections last year. Aluko, the immediate-past captain of the tennis section, informed that the tournament has been on for some few years. He recalled that the last one was held in 2018 by Lagos Country Club who came out top of the one-day challenge. “We expect stiff competition; we expect tough challenge. However winning is not the objective for the clubs, but to exercise, interact, network and cement friendship,” he said, adding they look forward to great hospitality by their hosts. The tourney would serve as preparations for LCC International Club tournament which would see them as guests to one of the top recreation clubs in Tanzania later this year. The LCC have featured in similar tourneys in Ghana, Rwanda and Germany.
