The video drops next month also, I plan to drop 3 singles this year.” He further noted that DJs are the life of a party and they should always have that in mind. “As a DJ, excellence should be your watch word when organising events. Whether it is a small party or a concert, you always have to bring your A game. Even when there is no groove, you can organize a house party as long as you have the resources to deliver an excellent show. Build your profile, so that you can approach big brands and get sponsorship. Also remember that you have to brush up your skills from time to time. So you can hold it down for the next 2 -3 hours.” On his relationship with Korede Bello he said, “It has been fun working with Korede Bello. He is a great dude easy going. Recording Celebrate was just a day vibe no stress. I call him MEGA. We play too much and we have toured the world together, we understand each other on stage.” He also hinted that they have another song coming out soon. “We have something coming out soon… another banger you will love it,” he enthused Speaking on how he has been able to shuffle playing at two radio stations and other jobs which also includes being Korede’s official DJ, he said “we wan dey out there in fact if I see 2 more radio stations  I will do. I just believe in hard work and I don’t limit myself. Just keep pushing God will hear you, I believe we all need to move higher. “I love my job have got great passion for it. Sometimes I think about the journey 15years is no beans and I see light in it. So, I am still pushing.
