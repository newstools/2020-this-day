The Nigeria Police Force Public Relations Officer, Frank Mba has described the force as the best place for sportsmen and women to achieve their full potentials and dreams. Mba, a deputy commissioner of police said at the weekend that the NPF structured the career of serving sports women and men in such flexible way that they can “eat their cakes and have them.” He further admitted that they are always encouraged to have the best of their sports and policing careers respectively. Speaking ahead of the 12th edition of the Police Games scheduled to hold between February 29 and March 7 in Awka, Anambra State, Mba confirmed that a total of 31 sports would be competed for at the events to take place in four centres in the state. Mba added that police athletes are always encouraged to get to the peak of their respective sports careers. “There are many examples to show that we are always ready to boost our athletes. We grant those exceptional leave of absence and when they retire, we reabsorb them into the service. “This is a huge contribution to development of sports and that is why we want to use the forthcoming Police Games to identify new talents and nurture them to the top,” stressed Mba. He also admitted further that there were plans to use the Games in Awka not only to prepare the police athletes for the forthcoming National Sports Festival in Benin but also to begin the process of bringing out athletes that would take over from great police ambassadors like Chioma Ajunwa, late Sunday Bada and Samuel Peter. A total of 12 zones will be competing at the games with all zones having three states each except zones 2 and 6. Zone 2 comprises only Lagos and Ogun while Zone 6 (Calabar) comprises four states. Rojenny Sports Complex and the NYSC Camp are some of the centres to host 31 sports in the forthcoming competition in Anambra State.
