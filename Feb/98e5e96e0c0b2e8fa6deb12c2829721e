 FairMoney,
mobile bank for emerging markets, has signed comedian and actor, Animashaun
Samuel Perry, known professionally as Broda Shaggi, as its brand ambassador. The deal is for an initial period
of one year and would see Broda Shaggi collaborate with FairMoney to reach its
grassroots audience. The comedian who is also a singer
and voiceover artist was said in a statement to have over three million
followers on Instagram and came into the limelight for his humorous social
media skits. Last December, Broda Shaggi featured
in FairMoney’s influencer marketing campaign dubbed, “The Friends Loan Test.”
The reception the brand received from the association signalled that the
comedian is a good fit. In the statement, FairMoney’s Head
of Direct Marketing, Seun Oratokhai, said both parties were pleased with the
terms of the contract. “Broda Shaggi was an obvious choice
following the interaction with consumers during the “Friends Loan Test” and the
“No Excuses” campaign which launched last year. Our consumers and target
audience also connected with him immensely during our roadshows and activations,”
Oratokhai said. FairMoney offers individuals and small businesses loans
from N1,500 to N150,000 through its free mobile app available in the Google
Play Store for Android users. FairMoney customers can also use the app to pay
for value-added services including airtime and data and pay-TV subscription
renewals with no transaction fees.
