Indeed, there have been frenetic preparations for the forthcoming 74th birthday celebrations of the former special assistant to former President Olusegun Obasanjo. This is totally understandable going by what the woman of substance represents, especially in both the business and political worlds.

Hence, it is believed that the event, which comes up on February 22, will definitely be a gathering of the high and mighty in the society.
