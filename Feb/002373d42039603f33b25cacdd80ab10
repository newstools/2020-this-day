  Goddy Egene Stanbic IBTC Capital Limited, a subsidiary of the Stanbic IBTC Holdings Plc has established a N300 billion Domestic Bond Programme for the African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank). The signing ceremony, which  marked the official kick-off of the initiative was held in Lagos. The establishment of the debt issuance programme in the Nigerian capital market by Afreximbank makes it the third supranational ever to join an elite group of Nigeria’s development partners, enabling the domestic capital market. It is vital to establish the bond programme in local currency, considering the strong liquidity and current low yields in the domestic market. This initiative by Afreximbank aligns with global best practice in treasury management and innovation to stay abreast of evolving market conditions. It will aid in stimulating the expansion and development of Nigeria, through the intervention in various sectors of the Nigerian economy. Afreximbank, a multi-product partner of Stanbic IBTC and the Standard Bank Group, is one of Africa’s largest Developmental Finance Institutions and a seasoned issuer in the international capital markets. Stanbic IBTC Capital Limited remains fully committed to developing the Nigerian capital markets and has been at the forefront of driving financial innovation and advising clients on staying ahead of changing times.

Profit before tax (PBT) rose from N88.15 billion for 2018 to N90.925 billion, just as PAT grew from N74.4 billion to N75.035 billion.
