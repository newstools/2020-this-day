Missions Global, Dr. Sesan Akinnawo said it was introduce to fend off youths
from idleness and crimes. He said: “Some of the youths are idle and because of idleness they are
involved in crimes. “In order to keep them busy and divert their energies into positive use African Missions Global came up
with encouraging sporting activities and competition.” He noted that each of the eight camps have been given sporting equipment
for table tennis, football, basketball and volley ball. He said the materials can be used even after the competition, revealing that “we already have a sport coordinator in
each of the camps to help them (IDPs) in the various sports. The Commissioner for Women Affairs, Hajiya Zuwaira Gambo, said the Borno
