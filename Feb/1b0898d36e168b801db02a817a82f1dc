Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja Kano State Zonal Office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has arrested the former speaker and now minority leader of Kano State House of Assembly, Isiyaku Ali Danja, over alleged abuse of office and misappropriation of N1.5 billion meant for payment of tax liabilities to the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS). Danja got into trouble following a petition that funds meant for payment of tax liabilities to FIRS by Kano State Government were allegedly diverted and misappropriated to the tune of over N1.5 billion from the sub-treasury account of the state government. Several suspicious payments were allegedly traced to some beneficiaries, including some made to Allad Drilling Limited, a company in which the suspect is the sole signatory. Investigation by EFCC revealed that the funds were on several occasions, personally withdrawn in cash by the suspect, while he was the only one who could officially state whether jobs were done before any payments could be made. It would be recalled that EFCC had earlier arrested Kano State Commissioner for Special Duties, Mukhtar Ishaq, for allegedly diverting funds meant for Kano Municipal Local Government while he was chairman of the said local government. Mukhtar was arrested by EFCC following a petition that alleged that while he was chairman of Kano Municipal, he diverted funds meant for projects, development and empowerment of the people. The petitioner alleged that Mukhtar ordered the deduction of N30,000 from the account of each council member without justification. Mukhtar was also alleged to have converted property of Kofar Nasarawa Primary School, Kano, into shops and sold same at the rate of N10 million per shop and diverted the money to personal use. Both suspects would be charged to court on completion of investigations, a statement by EFCC said.
