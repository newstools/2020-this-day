Teacher’s Diary No, don’t give up your break-time for any goodies offered to you. As a matter of fact, you need to impose brief breaks upon yourself after every hour or so of intense absorption and concentration on a task. A preferable observation of your break time would be:
leaving your work table or station; changing your environment; going to another area and switching off executive functions like: problem solving; planning; decision-making; calculating and executing. You constantly engage the frontal lobe region of your brain, many times to breaking point, at work. This area is the seat of your: cognitive functions; concentration; interest; motivation; emotions; language (speaking and writing) and your personality. Your frontal lobe also controls your social behaviours and responses. Little wonder then that a tired, fatigued brain is more prone to engendering impulsive and irrational behaviours. Don’t wait until you’re stumped by a problem or stooped over a decision before you intentionally take a break daily at work. Once you have established your job rules and you have negotiated the statutory time allocated to you for break at work, you must consciously use this allocated times to refuel so that you don’t burn out. The following are 15 benefits of regularly taking your break at work: •Breaks maintain your mental well-being at the least.

Lengthening your life is very much your responsibility in as much as you take extra care to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Break taking contributes to a healthy lifestyle. Omoru writes from the Uk
