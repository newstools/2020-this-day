President Muhammadu Buhari has mourned the departure of highlife maestro, Dr. Victor Olaiya, saying his place in history is guaranteed. President Buhari, in a statement issued by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, noted that the late musician was more than just an entertainer, but also a teacher of life’s lessons. Olaiya, a master-trumpet player, died on Wednesday at the age of 89 years. The president noted that the highlife maestro, known for his mastery of the trumpet, brought joy and delight to people across generations, with his songs which were both entertaining and didactic. According to President Buhari, “his place in history is guaranteed. He sang, not just for the entertainment value, but also taught critical lessons on life, good neighbourliness, and national cohesion. He will be sorely missed.” He urged the younger generations of musicians to learn a lesson from Olaiya, so that their songs can also remain evergreen, and outlive them. Noting that the departed musician’s works transcended Nigeria, the West Coast, and, indeed, the African continent, the President prayed God to rest Olaiya’s soul, and comfort all those who mourn him.
