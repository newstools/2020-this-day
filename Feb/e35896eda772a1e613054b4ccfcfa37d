Barely one week after Africa got a clean bill of health on coronavirus disease, Algeria has recorded a fresh case of the disease. The Cable reported that a man who was placed in isolation at an Egyptian hospital had tested negative to the disease. However, six days after what was described as good news for the continent broke out, Algerian authorities announced that an Italian citizen who arrived in the country on February 17 tested positive to the disease. “One case was confirmed positive for coronavirus (COVID-19), out of two suspected cases (both) of Italian nationality,” the North African country’s health ministry said in a broadcast. The victim’s identity was not stated and the hospital where he is currently being treated was not made public. The virus, which broke out in Wuhan, China, has now infected more than 80,000 globally, killing at least 2,700. Earlier yesterday, Iran’s Deputy Health Minister, Mr. Iraj Harirchi, announced that he had contracted the disease. Harirchi, who has spearheaded Iran’s efforts to contain the virus, said he would begin treatment immediately. “I wanted to tell you that I got corona. I had a fever yesterday. The tests came back positive last night. I isolated myself. Just a few moments ago, I was told that the final test came,” Harirchi had said in a video, which aired from his house. “I’ll start taking medicine. Generally, I feel fine. I just felt a bit tired, I had a fever, and it will drop.”
