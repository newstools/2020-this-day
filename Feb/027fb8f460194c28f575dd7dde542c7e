Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) yesterday presented two witnesses before Justice I.E Ekwo of the Federal High Court in Abuja against the former senator, representing Kaduna North senatorial district, Shehu Sani. The EFCC is prosecuting Sani on a two-count criminal charge bordering on intent to defraud and obtain the sum of $10,000.00 from one Alhaji Sani Dauda, under the false pretence that the money was meant to bribe the acting Chairman of the EFCC, Ibrahim Magu, to arrest and prosecute one Abubakar Musa. At the resumed trial, prosecuting counsel, Abba Mohammed, presented two witness-Beckley Ojo and Elizabeth Muka-who are compliance officers of Guaranty Trust Bank (GTB). Ojo, who is the first prosecution witness (PW1), told the court that he personally generated the statement of the beneficiaryâ€™s account and forwarded it to the EFCC. He further explained that the name of the beneficiary from the covering letter who received the sum of N3.5million from Sani Dauda is Shareef Zailani Shanono. According to him, the GTB cheque issued by Dauda was an instruction to transfer the sum of N3.5 million to Shanono. In the same vein, second prosecution witness (PW2), Muka, revealed that there was a transfer of N5million on November 20, 2019, which was carried out from the account of Dauda to one Abubakar Ahmed, adding that there was another N3million also transferred to Shanono. She further told the court that on January 23, 2020, she gathered the account opening documents, a cover memo and other documents and sent them to the EFCC as the commission requested. Justice Ekwo, however, adjourned the matter till February 26, 2020, for continuation of trial.
