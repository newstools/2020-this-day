 Delta State governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, has said that military
personnel accompanied suspected bandits who wreaked havoc on some communities
in the state last week. Gunmen had attacked Avwon, Agadama, Ohoror and other
communities in Uwheru Kingdom, Ughelli North local government areas of the
state on Thursday. The attacks led to the deaths of at least eight persons
while several others sustained injuries. Okowa, who described the attacks as mindless, called on security
agencies to bring the perpetrators to book. “The unwarranted attacks and killing of innocent locals in
Avwon, Agadama and Ohoror communities of Uwheru Kingdom in Ughelli North Local
Government Area and the wickedness of suspected herdsmen alleged to be aided
and abetted by unidentified military personnel are mindless,” Okowa said. “I, however, appeal to the affected communities to remain
calm and peaceful. I commiserate with the communities and families on the
unfortunate loss of their loved ones. “I have directed the Commissioner of Police and the Brigade
Commander, 63 Brigade, Nigerian Army, to rise to the occasion and bring the culprits
to justice. “As a state, our people have been very receptive to
herdsmen and other visitors, but our hospitality and welcoming disposition
should not be taken as an act of cowardice. “The state government will continue to encourage
peaceful and harmonious relations between Deltans and their visitors but will
not watch outsiders attack and kill our people any longer.”
