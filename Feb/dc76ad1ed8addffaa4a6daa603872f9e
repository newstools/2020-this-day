President Donald Trump of the United States of America was quick to congratulate the Kansas City Chiefs for winning their first Super Bowl in 50 years Sunday night. No sooner had the Chiefs dispatched the San Francisco 49ers than he tweeted: “Congratulations to the Kansas City Chiefs on a great game and a fantastic comeback, under immense pressure. You represented the Great State of Kansas and, in fact, the entire USA, so very well. Our Country is PROUD OF YOU! His exuberance was understandable, given the exciting game, and Kansans are certainly proud of the Chiefs, but the team is based in and plays in Kansas City, Missouri, not Kansas. Residents of both states happily share the team, but are protective of their identities. The tweet was quickly deleted and replaced with a corrected version of the same message. “Congratulations to the Kansas City Chiefs on a great game and a fantastic comeback under immense pressure,” it read. “We are proud of you and the Great State of Missouri. You are true Champions!”
