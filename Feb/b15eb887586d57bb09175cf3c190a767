Other dignitaries expected at the event include Minister of Transportation, Hon. Rotimi Amaechi (Chairman); former Ogun State Governor, Otunba Gbenga Daniel (Special Guest of Honour); former Deputy National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Olabode George (Keynote Speaker) and Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu (Guest of Honour).

According to Akinadewo, “Nigeria’s political, economic and social fabric is disintegrating due to the foundation of the country and something urgent must be done. Insecurity does not recognise a Christian or Muslim, it has no respect for APC or PDP. The security situation now is precarious. We must do a proper x-ray of the foundation of our security, our economy, our politics for Nigeria’s future to be secured” Pg 37
