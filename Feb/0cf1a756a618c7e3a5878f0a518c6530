 Manchester City have been banned from
European club competition for the next two seasons after being found to have
committed “serious breaches” of Uefa’s club licensing and financial fair play
regulations. The reigning Premier
League champions have also been fined 30m euros (£25m). The decision is
subject to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Manchester City
say they are “disappointed but not surprised” by the “prejudicial” decision and
will appeal. The independent Adjudicatory
Chamber of the Club Financial Control Body (CFCB) said City had broken the
rules by “overstating its sponsorship revenue in its accounts and in the break-even
information submitted to Uefa between 2012 and 2016”, adding that the club
“failed to cooperate in the investigation”. Manchester City said in a statement: “The club has
always anticipated the ultimate need to seek out an independent body and
process to impartially consider the comprehensive body of irrefutable evidence
in support of its position. “In December 2018, the Uefa chief investigator
publicly previewed the outcome and sanction he intended to be delivered to
Manchester City, before any investigation had even begun. “The subsequent flawed and consistently leaked
Uefa process he oversaw has meant that there was little doubt in the result
that he would deliver. The club has formally complained to the Uefa
disciplinary body, a complaint which was validated by a CAS ruling. “Simply put, this is a case initiated by Uefa,
prosecuted by Uefa and judged by Uefa. With this prejudicial process now over,
the club will pursue an impartial judgment as quickly as possible and will
therefore, in the first instance, commence proceedings with the Court of Arbitration
for Sport at the earliest opportunity.” City have been drawn to face Real Madrid in the
last 16 of this season’s Champions League, with the first leg to be played on
26 February at the Bernabeu.
