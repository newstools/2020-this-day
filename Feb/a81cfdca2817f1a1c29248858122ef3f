 None of Nigeria’s 36
states could fully fund their 2019 budget with funds they received from both
the federation account and internally generated revenues. In most cases, the
funds couldn’t pay up to 50 per cent of their expenditures, writes Chineme
Okafor. A new quarterly report –
‘analysis of 2019 FAAC disbursements’ – which the Nigeria Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiatives (NEITI) released recently, has disclosed that states
in Nigeria are in financial distress. The report provided an
analysis of the payout to the states by the Federation Accounts Allocation
Committee (FAAC) for the year 2019. It used from the National
Bureau of Statistics (NBS), NEITI’s attendance at FAAC meetings, and the Office
of the Accountant General of the Federation to assess and reveal the financial
struggles of the states. According to the report,
in 2019 the total FAAC disbursements were N8.147 trillion with the federal government’s
share amounting to N3.376 trillion while the states and local governments got
N2.761 trillion and N1.649 trillion respectively. From the FAAC earnings of
the states, the report also showed that a state – Osun – got the lowest
disbursed figure of N24.14 billion in 2019 while Delta got the highest figure
of N218.58 billion. In percentage terms, Osun’s FAAC earnings was only able to
cover 37 per cent and 15.63 per cent of its recurrent and budget expenditures. What they earned from
FAAC In its analysis of the
disbursement patterns, the NEITI disclosed that three states received less than
N40 billion from the FAAC in 2019, and they included Osun – N24.14 billion,
Cross River – N36.22 billion and Ogun – N38.63 billion. It further stated that
nine states received between N40 billion and N49 billion and they were Gombe
which got 40.93 billion, Ekiti – N41.2 billion, Zamfara – N41.67 billion,
Plateau – N42.13 billion, Kwara – N42.35 billion, Ebonyi – N44.54 billion,
Nassarawa – N44.78 billion, Taraba – N46.43 billion, and Adamawa  which
was paid 48.25 billion from the FAAC. Additionally, 14 states
received between N50 billion and N59 billion. They included Yobe (N51.51
billion), Enugu (N51.89 billion), Abia (N51.93 billion), Kogi (N52.23 billion),
Bauchi (N52.25 billion), Kebbi (N52.81 billion), Anambra (N53.8 billion), Benue
(N54.24 billion), Sokoto (N55.38 billion), Oyo (N55.7 billion), Imo (N55.95
billion), Niger (N56.34 billion), Ondo (N57.79 billion), and Jigawa (N58.76
billion) while four states which received between N60 billion and N69 billion
were Borno (N61.6 billion), Katsina (N63.14 billion), Edo (N64.43 billion), and
Kaduna (N66.98 billion). Kano State received N82.34 billion. Amongst the states which
got more than N100 billion from the FAAC were Lagos – N117.76 billion, Bayelsa
– N139.69 billion, Rivers – N158 billion, Akwa Ibom – N171.43 billion and Delta
– N218.58 billion. The NEITI report informed
that four of the five states in the highly-paid categories were in the Niger
Delta region – Rivers, Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa and Delta, and they earned that much
on the back of the 13 per cent derivation principle. Inadequate for recurrent,
budget expenditure Despite their earnings,
the NEITI explained that the states could not stay financially buoyant in 2019.
It noted that net disbursements were only adequate in covering the recurrent
expenditure of 15 states and inadequate in covering the full budgets of all the
states. “The values (net FAAC
disbursements expressed as a percentage of recurrent expenditure) range between
36.9 per cent in Osun State and 151.8 per cent in Akwa Ibom State. The
percentages were below 100 per cent in 21 states: Osun, Ogun, Oyo, Plateau,
Kogi, Lagos, Kwara, Ondo, Abia, Ekiti, Adamawa, Taraba, Gombe, Edo, Bauchi,
Niger, Benue, Sokoto, Cross River, Jigawa and Enugu. “For these states, the
implications are that net FAAC disbursements alone cannot service their
recurrent expenditure. Thus, for their most basic expenditure, these states
have to rely on both FAAC disbursements and IGR,” said the report. “There are 15 states
where the net FAAC disbursements expressed as percentage of recurrent
expenditure was above 100 per cent. These states are: Bayelsa, Zamfara, Kano,
Nassarawa, Delta, Katsina, Kaduna, Rivers, Anambra, Borno, Imo, Yobe, Ebonyi,
Kebbi and Akwa Ibom. “These figures mean that
these states were able to fund their recurrent expenditure completely from
their net FAAC disbursements. Thus, excess funds would be left for capital
expenditure,” it added. The NEITI also indicated
that in terms of net FAAC disbursements expressed as a percentage of the state
budgets for 2019, they ranged from 3.4 per cent in Cross River to 56.2 per cent
in Yobe. According to it, “the
figures clearly indicate that no state was able to finance its total budget
based on FAAC disbursements alone.” It stated that the
situation appeared quite critical, “as this percentage was above 50 per cent in
only two states: Delta State (56 per cent) and Yobe State (56.2 per cent).” “Thus, for almost all
states, FAAC disbursements were quite inadequate in servicing their budgets.
These states would need IGR to fulfil this purpose,” the NEITI further
explained. In terms of total revenue
expressed as percentage of budgets, the NEITI equally stated that the total
revenue of the states which included net FAAC disbursements and Internally
Generated Revenue (IGR) ranged from 5.9 per cent in Cross River state to 72.9
per cent in Delta State. “These percentages show
that even with the addition of IGR to FAAC disbursements, no state can
independently finance its budget. Thus, all states would be faced with the
option of either not fully implementing their budgets or borrowing to achieve
this,” the NEITI said. The report thus indicated
that in Cross River for example where its government proposed a budget estimate
of N1.043 trillion tagged budget of `Qabalistic Densification’ in 2019, it was
only able to fund it by a meagre 5.9 per cent. Better oil price could
save the day Pointing to oil price
variations as one of the reasons for low FAAC earning by the states in 2019,
the NEITI therefore suggested that a healthier oil price in 2020 could help the
states beat back their financial troubles. It said that the monthly
price of crude oil analysed between January 2015 and December 2019 showed that
oil prices experienced a big drop from late 2018. “Starting from January
2019, oil prices started rising, but have not reached the highest level
experienced in 2018. The lower oil prices contributed to lower revenues which
ultimately led to the lower figures for FAAC disbursements starting from
January 2019. “Average oil prices were
$56.9 per barrel in 2019. Compared with average oil prices of $64.9 per barrel
in 2018, average oil prices in 2019 were lower by 12 per cent,” the NEITI
noted. According to it:
“Available data for the first month of 2020 shows average oil price of $58.6
per barrel. This suggests that oil prices have experienced an increase over the
2019 figures.” The NEITI stated that if
efforts by member countries of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) and its allies led by the Russian Federation to stem falling
oil prices are sustained, then it is hoped that oil prices will not fall
further, adding thus: “If this happens, it will result in increased revenue for
the federation, and ultimately boost FAAC disbursements in 2020.” The Central Bank of Nigeria
(CBN) Governor, had said instead of depending on handouts from the Federation
Account; states could explore their areas of strength to shore up their IGR. Emefiele, had noted that
looking inward remained a viable alternative to make the states viable in the
face of the dwindling oil cash. Emefiele said: “I do not
think states can’t be viable. They were self- sustaining in the days of
regions. I don’t like states coming to Abuja with pan in hands. “We’ve abandoned
agriculture. Everybody is now depending on oil. States can be viable if they
leverage on their advantage.” He had added: “Our story
in rice production has yielded positive results. At this point it really fit to
thank and commend the federal government for the border closure. “Whereas at the CBN we have been doing everything
possible through blocking of accounts and all that to restrict smuggling of
rice into the country, but we think the border closure has resulted in very
good result for all of us and I will give you an example.”
