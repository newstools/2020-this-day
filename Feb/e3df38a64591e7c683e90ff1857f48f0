Mbok, ayeneka, ku yard esit. Please don’t vex that I could not make your lovely father’s funeral. You know the weather at that period was tough and they were diverting flights. That was how I ended up in Accra, ask Dele Momodu he saw me entering the gents. How the remaining people got there in that confusion still confounds me. Anyways, I hear it was a grand occasion and you pulled in so many forces from across the divide. Showing your pull and weight. Welldone I saw the pictures, everybody was there o. From Chief Obasanjo to Saraki and star boy – the Vice President and so many dignitaries. Your dad lived well at least he born you and as such, you celebrated him the way you did. Welldone sir.
