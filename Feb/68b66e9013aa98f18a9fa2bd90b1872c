 Oluchi Chibuzor As part of its
contribution to humanity and celebration of Rotary international vocational
service month, Maryland Rotary Club has honoured officers of the Nigerian
Police and Lagos State Traffic Management Agency (LASTMA) and also presented a
cash of N25, 000. Speaking at the
ceremony in Lagos, recently, the Club President, Dr. Adewale Sanni, said the
various government officials recognised at the event displayed courage,
diligence despite dangers and risks associated at the various points of duties. “We did our
feasibility studies very well to actually know those who are in needs of this
support in this month of vocational service as Rotary Club of Maryland. “This is
to reward those who were doing well and never thought people were watching them
in discharge of their duties and also for people who need support to boost
their businesses to move higher in life.” The club noted
that the reward for excellence came after two months of facts-finding and
recommendation from the public and colleagues to recipients. In his remarks,
the Chairman, Vocational Service Committee, Mr. Bamidele Onalaja, said the
awards to the recipients would spur more commitment from those entrusted
with service to humanity beyond borders. “That is
why we went as far as going to their post of duties to give them the awards and
as you can see passersby was cheering them up and echoing they deserve it. To
them we believe they never saw it coming but today they are been
celebrated.” On her part, an
Officer of the Nigeria Police Force (NPF) Inspector, Okwudi Dianna, expressed
appreciation to God, stating that she never knew that people were watching
her, “was just surprised when their President came and told me that they have
an award for me.”
