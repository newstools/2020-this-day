The solutions on display at ISW 2020 will include balloon-powered satellites, AI-driven fraud detection, blockchain-powered anti-counterfeiting, computer-vision powered glasses for the visually impaired and other deep tech solutions built by the 18 startups from West Africa.

Last year, the first Showcase Week, saw over 250 executives including top-level executives from multinationals attend the two-day exhibition which birthed over 50 interests between the startups and corporates. In 2019, six of the showcasing startups raised over $500,000 including Chekkit who recently secured its position as the only African company to be accepted into a global accelerator and received a grant from Umdasch Challenge at the World Summit Awards 2020.
