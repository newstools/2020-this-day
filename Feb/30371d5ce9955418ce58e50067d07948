 Akinwale Akintunde A legal practitioner, Emankhu Isibor Addah,
has dragged the Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki and the Inspector General of
Police, Mohammed Adamu to court for what he described as “illegal order” made
by the governor, banning all forms of political rallies in Edo State. In the suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/133/2020
filed before the Federal High Court in Abuja Addah is challenging Obaseki’s ban
on rallies. The governor, who is the 1st respondent in
the suit, had on December 13 through the Secretary to the State Government,
announced publicly the total and complete ban on all political rallies,
demonstrations and or procession in any part of Edo State. The applicant, who is also a politician in
the state, is asking the court to declare that the statement or declaration by
Obaseki that it has placed a total and complete ban on all political rallies,
demonstration or procession in any part of Edo State, is unlawful and a
violation of his fundamental rights as entrenched in Section 40 of the 1999
Constitution and Article 11 of the African Charter on Human and People’s Rights
(Ratification and Enforcement) Act Cap A9 LFN 2204. Addah is also praying the court for a
mandatory injunction against the respondents, its men and officers, agents
jointly and severally, to immediately cease and stop giving effect to the
enforcement of the said total and complete ban on all political rallies in any
part of Edo State. Addah also asked the court to award him the
sum of N100 million as aggravated damages for the unlawful restriction of his
fundamental rights to associate freely with other persons for lawful purposes. Beside this, the applicant wants the court
to order a perpetual injunction restraining the Obaseki and the IG.
