The Department of State Services (DSS) has denied arresting two sons of the Chief Justice of Nigeria, Mr. Sirajo and Mr. Sanni Tanko. The DSS spokesperson, Mr. Peter Afunanya, said, “They were not arrested; we didn’t arrest the two sons of the CJN.” The report said the aide of a former President confirmed that their phones were seized and all call logs, as well as messages were searched. The report claimed one of the two sons had been released on bail while one was still a guest of the DSS as of Monday morning. The report while quoting the former presidential aide said their arrest was to arm-twist the CJN to reverse the recent Supreme Court judgment on Bayelsa State. “It is part of the schemes to intimidate the Supreme Court to revert the Bayelsa election in favour of the All Progressives Congress (APC),” the reported quoted the former aide.
