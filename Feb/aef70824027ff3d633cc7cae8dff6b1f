The Edo State Government has said it has resisted the anti-competition tactics deployed by the Benin Electricity Distribution Company (BEDC) in attempting to scuttle the operations of Ossiomo Power Infrastructure Company in the state.  The Edo State Deputy Governor, Rt. Hon. Comrade Philip Shaibu said the state government took the decision because BEDC has failed in the discharge of its responsibilities to Edo people, and would rather the people remain in darkness than seek the services of alternative power providers.  Shaibu said this during a meeting to deliberate on the lingering issues between BEDC, Ossiomo Power Infrastructure Company and the state government on the construction of a 33KVA transmission line to connect state government assets to an injection sub-station at Sapele Road in Benin City.  According to him, “A tripartite committee was set up to resolve the issues between BEDC and Ossiomo Power Infrastructure Company. Today is the deadline to conclude on the matter and sign the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), but as usual, BEDC officials are not here again.  “The meetings to resolve the issues have been on for over a year now, but we have continued to reschedule meetings at the instance of BEDC, and only once on the part of Ossiomo Power. As BEDC officials are not here, the Edo State Government is left with no choice than to direct the project contractor to continue the work on the construction of the 33KVA transmission line to connect Edo State Government sub-station at Sapele Road Benin City without any interference or hindrance from the BEDC or any other entity.”  The Deputy Governor continued, “Edo State Government requests the National Electricity Regulation Commission (NERC) or any other institution responsible thereto, to direct Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) to grant the outage requested to Edo State Government to enable the completion of the line.”
