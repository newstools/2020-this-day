Alex Enumah in Abuja The Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Ibrahim Muhammad, is presiding over a seven-man panel to hear the appeal of the former Imo State Governor, Hon. Emeka Ihedioha, seeking a review of the apex court verdict that removed him from office on January 14. Other justices sitting in the panel include: Justices Sylvester Ngwuta, Kayode Ariwoola, Kudirat Kekere-Ekun, Amina Augie, Adamu Galinje and Uwani Aba-Aji. Ihedioha, in the appeal filed on February 6, is asking the apex court to set aside its judgment which removed him from office on the grounds that the judgment was a nullity and as such is liable for a review and subsequently reversal.
