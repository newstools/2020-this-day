A police spokesperson said: “Greater Manchester Police are currently investigating allegations made regarding the Computer Misuse Act. “A 30-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of offences under the Computer Misuse Act 1990. “He has been released under investigation.” A City spokeswoman said: “While we had terminated the services of this consultant and the company he was contracted to two years ago, we were unaware of the serious crimes he is alleged to have committed whilst working with us and the subsequent alleged attempts to profit from those crimes. “It is a matter of public record that we have been the target of several criminal attacks through our IT systems in recent years.”
