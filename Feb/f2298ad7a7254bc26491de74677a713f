Duty Paid Value (DPV) break down of the seized items is as follows: Rice N27,860,000.00, Veg. Oil N6,284,250.00 and frozen Poultry N6,000,000.00).”
Yahaya warned that unless the economic saboteurs repent from their unscrupulous activities, they will continue to count their losses. He also advised legitimate traders to be compliant in their declarations as the unit is ever ready to facilitate their trade in line with world best practices. While thanking the Comptroller General of Customs and the entire management team of the Nigeria Customs Service for providing necessary logistics and motivation that led to this feat, Yahaya called on all meaningful Nigerians to support the Service’s fight against smuggling activities by providing intelligence that could assist the unit achieve more monumental seizures.
