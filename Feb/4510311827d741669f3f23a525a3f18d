star Mohamed Salah in their squad for this summer’s Olympic Games in Tokyo. Under 23 coach Shawky Gharib has said Salah will be one of three senior stars named in their squad for the prestigious event. News of Salah’s inclusion will come as a blow to Jurgen Klopp as the German wanted one of his star players with him during pre-season.
The football tournament at the Olympics will run from July 22 to August 8, the same day the 2020-21 Premier League season is due to kick off. Gharib, speaking to ON Sport, said of Salah: ‘Out of the three senior players we’ll call-up, Salah is the only one we’re settled on so far because he’s simply one of the top three players in the world. ‘I haven’t talked to Salah at all about him joining the U-23 squad for the Olympics, but in all honesty, his participation in the Olympics will need a little effort from him as well.’ Salah is likely to miss the start of next season if he does decide to represent his country at the Olympics as he will need a break before returning to Liverpool. Klopp previously said of the possibility of Salah going to the Olympics: ‘No decision made yet. What I have to say to him I will say it to Mo (Salah), so that is all. ‘Neither side has made a decision. I wish we could have whole squad together for pre-season but that is not possible for different reasons. ‘Olympics is a wonderful thing but it would not be too cool. No decision made yet.’ Salah and his Liverpool team-mates return to Premier League action following their winter break on Saturday evening when they face Norwich at Carrow Road.
