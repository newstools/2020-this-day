 The Government of Tanzania Ministry of
Finance, has signed a facility agreement with Standard Chartered (SC.com)
Tanzania for a US$ 1.46 billion term loan financing to fund the construction of
the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) project from Dar es Salaam to Makutupora. Running approximately 550 kilometres long,
the SGR project is one of the country’s biggest projects connecting Dodoma to
Dar es Salaam via Morogoro and Makutupora. Once completed, the SGR Rail project
would provide a safe and reliable means for efficiently transporting people and
cargo to and from the existing Dar es Salaam Port. According to the Tanzania Railways Corporation,
it was expected that the railway would address current congestion challenges
and decrease freight service charges by 40 per cent, as the railway would be
able to haul up to 10,000 tons of freight, equivalent to 500 lorries, per trip.
It will also connect Tanzania to Burundi, Rwanda and The Democratic Republic of
Congo, DRC, thereby playing a key role in enhancing regional trade. The project
has already created more than 8,000 new direct employment opportunities for
Tanzanians and has opened up opportunities for the local communities
surrounding the project area to access social services such as shelter and
food. Standard Chartered Tanzania acted as Global
Co-ordinator, Bookrunner and Mandated Lead Arranger on the facility agreement
that is the largest foreign currency financing raised by the Ministry of
Finance to date. The biggest component of financing comes from the Export
Credit Agency Covered Facility(‘s) from the Export Credit Agencies of Denmark
and Sweden. Speaking at the event to sign off the deal,
the Minister of Finance and Planning, Hon. Dr. Philip Mpango, commended and
thanked Standard Chartered Tanzania.
