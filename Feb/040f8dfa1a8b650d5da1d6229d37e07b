Last weekend, a major memorial tournament was held in honour of one of Nigeria’s main golf icons, late Chief Sam Iredia. The tourney was played on the vast course of the University of Benin Teaching Hospital [UBTH] Golf Club. Over100 golfers from Edo State and golfing friends of Iredia from across the nation participated in the event. The Captain of the Club, Professor Gabriel Ofevwe, noted that it was important to host such big event in honour of Iredia because until his death he was the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Club. Besides, Ofevwe mentioned that it was through the extra push from Iredia that made several intellectuals within the university community to take to the game of golf. “Through the founder, Professor Eugene Okpere, we just happened on this pretty golf course”, Ofevwe stated. “Most of us know the game but were not really playing. But the late Iredia would come around and and lecture us on the gains of the game. “We took his fatherly advise and took to the game. We are all better off for it today. So honouring his passing with such a big event like this is just our own little way of thanking the real golf icon of our time for his precious support to the development of this great club which remains the only West African university with a golf course”. Three sons of Iredia who came home from their United States of America base took turn to hit a drive during the ceremonial tee off. They were amazed that their father did so much for the nation’ golf to merit such honorary event.
