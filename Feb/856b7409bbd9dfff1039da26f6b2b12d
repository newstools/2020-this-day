Access Bank through the Avant-Garde series on CNN is retelling the African story, which entails an upsurge of creativity in the areas of arts, fashion, music and film. The Group Managing Director of Access Bank Plc, Herbert Wigwe, while speaking on changing the African narrative to the world, stated that it becomes imperative to introduce a platform that will serve as a springboard to help launch these creative minds to the rest of the world. According to Wigwe, “At Access Bank, we have always been committed to driving innovation, supporting African creative talents, and retelling the African story. We are excited to partner with a global media house to let the world know that there is so much to celebrate in Africa. This partnership is one of the ways we demonstrate our commitment and resolve towards changing the narrative and we are confident it will yield tremendous impact.” Avant-Garde tells stories about contemporary African culture on CNN, in a bid to better connect the world to the African continent by celebrating the dynamism and creativity of African talents. The stories are told in a way that shows the richly inherited culture passed down from generation to generation; telling tales that date back to the pre-colonial era to the colonial era and then the post-colonial era. The use of strong multimedia storytelling has been imbibed to showcase innovative designers, talented artists and those driving creativity in Africa, such as Laetitia Ky and Stephen Tayo. The series also features stories on why it is important to be an African today, a South Sudanese refugee making it in the fashion industry, the first black female to be a contender on the Palme d’Or and also Noma Osula, the photographer challenging social norms in Nigeria and a host of other enlightening stories. The Access Bank Group Managing Director said the bank is proud to be a sponsor of this informative series which echoes the bank’s belief in supporting the creative industry.
