Delta State Assistant Cycling Coach, Moses Omozusi, has said the state will win the Sunday Ajayi sponsored MASVI Invitational Cycling race scheduled for Owan West on Saturday. Omozusi who ruled Nigeria’s cycling with Edo and later Delta states in the late 1990s boasted that the Owan race trophies will be going to Asaba . “We won the first two positions of the female category in Ilorin in December last year. We are set for the maiden edition of the MASVI race. Nothing can stop us this time around from winning the male and female categories,” he stressed. The Benin-born coach said Delta will bank on riders like Ese Ukpeseraye, Gloria Odiase, Iroh Obadiari and Odiasi Onyebuchi in the female race while Abaka Kurotimi, Olalekan Azeez, Akirotimi Israel and Garba Aminu will lift the male Cup. He however, said the race will not be an easy one as Edo, Oyo, Lagos and Ogun will give his cyclists a good run for their money. “This competition will be a very tough one because the very best cyclists in the country will be participating in the MASVI Invitational tourney,” he said The Chairman of Technical Committee of the Cycling Federation of Nigeria (CFN), Dr Emmanuel Igbinosa, who doubles as the Secretary of the LOC for the Edo 2020 National Sports Festival, said the race is coming at a very good time because it will help prepare Team Edo for the National Sports Festival holding in Benin next month. He also showered encomiun on the Chairman of Owan West Local Government Area, Hon. Frank Ilaboya for his partnership with the Cycling Federation of Nigeria in promoting cycling in the state.
