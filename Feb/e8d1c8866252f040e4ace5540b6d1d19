In line with its resolve to encourage public private partnership and turning sports into a viable business, the Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development has entered into an agreement with Nilayo Sports Management Limited as the official marketer of Team Nigeria to the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed by the Minister, Mr. Sunday Dare and Nilayo CEO. In his remarks, the Minister said: “We gave them the marketing rights having considered the profiles and track records of several other marketing companies. We feel that Nilayo has what it takes to market Team Nigeria to the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.” In his response, Nilayo CEO, Bukola Olopade, commended the Ministry under the leadership of Mr. Sunday Dare, stressing that his arrival signals the best time for sports entrepreneurs. He promised that the target given would be met and possibly surpassed.
He also applauded the minister’s ‘Adopt-an-Athlete’ initiative which he said is gaining ground. He assured stakeholders that he would work round the clock to ensure that enough funds are raised for Team Nigeria in line with the agreements reached.
