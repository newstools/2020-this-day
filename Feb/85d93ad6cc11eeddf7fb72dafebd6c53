 Goddy Egene Investors
staked N12.126 billion on 912.175 million shares in 17,083 deals at the stock
market last week, showing a decline of 40.2 per cent compared with N20.295
billion invested in 1.478 billion shares in 23,263 deals the previous week. The
lower market turnover resulted from weak sentiments that continued to dominate
the domestic stock market. The
bearish trend led to the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) All-Share Index,
shedding 1.1 per cent to close at 27,755.87, while market capitalisation shed
N162.1 billion to close at N14.456 trillion. This
was the third consecutive week that NSE ASI would decline, bringing the
year-to-date decline to 3.4 per cent. Analysis
by sectors for the week showed that the NSE Consumer Goods Index recorded the
highest decline, falling by 6.5 per cent, trailed by NSE Insurance Index with
2.2 per cent. The
NSE Oil & Gas Index shed 0.7 per cent, just as the NSE Banking Index went
down by 0.7 per cent. The sole gainer for the week was the NSE Industrial Goods
Index that appreciated by 0.78 per cent. Commenting
on the market performance, analysts at Cordros Capital said the bearish trend
would likely continue, noting that weakening market sentiment and the absence
of positive catalysts are expected to pressure market returns. “Nonetheless,
we advise investors to take positions in fundamentally justified stocks,” they
said. Although
the market has been bearish since February, some market operators remained
optimistic that the market will end 2020 on positive note. According
to the Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of APT Securities and
Funds Limited, Mallam Garba Kurfi, the market would close 2020 on positive
note after declining in 2018 and 2019. “The
NSE ASI is likely going to close 2020 positively and record close in
double-digit growth.  Both technical and fundamental analyses move to the
positive direction.  However, the market may experience volatility because
of the changes in the reporting financial reports as adopted by the exchange
without adequate awareness of the brokers. “Also,
I foresee banks unlikely to make more profits like they did in 2019
because they are pressured by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) directive to
meet up 65 per cent loan to deposit ratio (LDR),” Kurfi added. But
he noted that the review of Cash Reverse Ratio (CRR) from 22.50 per
cent to 27.50 per cent,  by CBN would redirect funds into the stock
market, explaining that  the restriction placed by apex bank  on Open
Market Operation and Treasury Bills participation, if sustained, would
also  impact positively on the stock market,” he said. Kurfi,
who is a former Council Member of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) and
currently Board Member of the Investment   and Securities Tribunal
(IST) noted that the demutualisation of the NSE, would  lead to
a more virile stock market, activate idle capital and boost  economic
activities. “The demutualisation
of the  NSE  would make  the exchange to function better like
its peers  such as the  Johannesburg Securities Exchange (JSE),
Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) that had already undergone the process. “It
is a good thing and all of us are going to be happy at the end of the day
because it is going to unlock more capital for the market.  For instance,
if I place shares as collateral, I can trade and make money, we are pleased
this is coming after so much delay,” he said. Looking
ahead, Kurfi said companies that benefit from Value-added tax (VAT) exemption
such as water, sanitary products, will likely  declare better profits. He
added that building material companies such as cement  firms, are likely
to double their turnover and bottom-line because of early implementation of the
budget and focus on infrastructural development. Market turnover Meanwhile,
