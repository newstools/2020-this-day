 Oluchi Chibuzor The Lagos State Government has revealed plan
to establish Eko-City Farmers Markets, aimed at connecting all the agricultural
value chains with their markets. The State Commissioner for Agriculture, Prince
Gbolahan Lawal, disclosed this recently at a stakeholders’ meeting on the
implementation of the Eko-City Farmers’ Market. He said the Eko City Farmers’ Market was part
of the commitment of the state government to making Lagos a 21st century
economy as well as deliver change in the agricultural land space. awal explained that the Eko- City Farmers’
Market is intended to increase productivity of farmers as well as create an
avenue for inclusive business where farmers make more profit since they are
selling directly to consumers. According to the Commissioner, the state government
would provide a conducive environment and other needed services like cold
storage for fish farmers, haulage and some logistics for farmers and vendors to
market their produce. “Farmers in the state lack direct access to
markets and this led to the selling of their produce to middlemen at ridiculous
farm gate prices. Farmers that are able to penetrate the market find it
difficult to break through cartels by the market associations,” he said. Lawal, explained that the objectives of the
markets were to connect producers and make shopping entertaining; to make
produce accessible and affordable to consumers; to preserve the nutritional
value of farm produce and to promote the, “farm to fork” concept of the input
and output policy of the state government. “Farmers in the state lack direct access to
markets, a situation that has led to them selling their produce to middlemen at
rather ridiculous farm gate prices adding that the Eko –City Framers’ Market
would help in eradicating this.



“The maiden edition of the
Eko City Framers’ Market would hold on Sunday, 23rd February, 2020 and subsequently
holds every month
