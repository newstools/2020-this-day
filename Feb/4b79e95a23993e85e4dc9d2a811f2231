The companyâ€™s performance reflected the impact of the equity injection the company witnessed towards the end of last year that helped to reduce the financing cost. Fidson Healthcare Plc last year successfully raised N2.345 billion equity capital from existing shareholders to boost its operations. The company made a rights issue of 750 million shares of 50 kobo at N4.00 on the basis of one new share for every per share to raise N3 billion. However, it ended up with N2.345 billion, translating to 78.18 per cent of the issue. According to the company, the new capital would be used to boost working capital that had been negatively impacted by the depreciation of Naira. The company had also explained that its new factory that came on stream at the tail end of 2016 needed additional capital to realise the full potential and utilise the new factory to full capacity.
