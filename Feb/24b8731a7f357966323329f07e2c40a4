This was confirmed by The Association of Licensed Telecommunications Operators of Nigeria (ALTON), which issued a statement to notify the subscribers across all the networks of implementation of the VAT increase effective February 1. The statement was signed by its Chairman, Mr. Gbenga Adebayo and Head of Operations, Gbolahan Awonuga.
