 President of Nigeria Football Coaches Association, Ladan Bosso has
disputed a claim by manager Gernot Rohr that newly appointed assistant coach of
the national team; Joseph Yobo has no coaching qualifications. The Franco-German football tactician did not mince his words when he
stated that the former Everton defender must have a coaching diploma in order
to grow as a coach. Bosso, who was privy to the appointment of Yobo by the Nigerian Federation
before it was officially announced, stressed that the Super Eagles legend has
met two of the three criteria required to be a coach in these parts, adding
that he’s only lacking work experience. “Yobo just came back from a course. Basically there are three criteria.
The first one is your certificate, then the second one is your playing
experience, then your work experience. He has two out of the three – playing
experience and his certificate,’’ Bosso said in an interview with Nigeria Info
FM “Yobo has been a registered member of the coaching association in Rivers
State. “Of course, I am supporting the process that brought Yobo in. He must have
shown interest before accepting the job or gone for a course. “He’s coming there as a second assistant coach not even the first. Salisu has a contract with the NFF except otherwise.” Bosso went on to say that Yobo will get the backing and confidence of
the present Super Eagles players because he previously played the game at a high level and captained the squad. “Most of the Super Eagles players basically are based in Europe, he is
used to those places. The Super Eagles players on ground will give him respect
because he’s an ex-international, he has captained the
Super Eagles,’’ he added. On if he sees Yobo eventually coaching the Super Eagles, Bosso said :
“With time, nobody can tell”. Yobo is the joint most capped Nigeria
player in history, earning 101 caps in total before
retiring after the 2014 World Cup.
