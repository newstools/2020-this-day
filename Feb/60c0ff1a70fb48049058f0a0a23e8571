Besides, the depreciation was recorded despite the visit of the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed to the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE). The minister was on the floor of the exchange and assured market operators of federal government’s plans to come up with more tax incentives that would attract more investments to the market.
