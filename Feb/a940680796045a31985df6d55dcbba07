 Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja Protesters under the aegis of All Progressives Congress (APC) Young Stakeholders yesterday stormed the national secretariat of the party in Abuja demanding the sack of the National Chairman, Mr. Adams Oshiomhole. The call for his sack may not be unconnected with last week’s  judgment of the Supreme Court, which sacked the APC candidate, who was the governor-elect, Mr. David Lyon. The apex court had sacked Lyon on the grounds that his deputy, Senator Biobarakuma Degi-Eremienyo presented false information to INEC in aid of his qualification for the November 16 governorship election in Bayelsa State. However, the protesters who stormed the secretariat at about 11.00 a.m, were armed with various placards with inscriptions such as: “Oshiomhole Must Go,” “Oshiomhole go home,” “We are tired of losing,” among others. The protesters described Oshiomhole’s continued stay in office as a curse, stressing that it would bring misfortune to the  party, adding that his action has decimated the number of the states controlled by APC  from 24 to 18 . While speaking on behalf of the protesters, Mr. Genesis Johnson, accused Oshiomole of impunity particularly over the nullification of the party’s victory in Bayelsa State by the Supreme court. He said that his impunity had caused the party a major lost in states like Zamfara. Johnson stated: “Look at what happen in Bayelsa State; it was caused by Oshiomhole and we say ‘enough is enough’. We want him to park his load and leave that office. He is not the only Nigerian that can manage that office. “Since he came into this office, he has been creating problems for this party. We suffered to win election and at the end of the day, opposition will go to court and collect the state. We are not happy with his conduct and we are the party faithful; we ask him to go; we put him there. Bringing Oshiomole is like bringing curse to the party.”
