Meanwhile, Abia Warriors have sacked Coach Emmanuel Deutcsh as the Head Coach of the Umuahia based team.In a press statement signed by the Club’s Secretary, Mr Esiaba Ebere, said losing three matches in a row, and conceding nine goals in the process does not portray the qualities of an ambitious team like Abia Warriors. The club was particularly irked losing the Abia Derby by such scandalous margin of four goals against Enyimba.
