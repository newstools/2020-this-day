Omon-Julius Onabu One person was killed and two others left with bullet wounds when some hoodlums alleged to be political thugs invaded the venue of a meeting of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) at Emu-Unor in Ndokwa West Local Government Area of Delta State at the weekend. The thugs reportedly invaded the political meeting at the premises of one of the party’s local leaders, shooting indiscriminately and causing confusion as people ran for cover. The man killed in the incident was identified simply as Onyeka, who was, however, believed to be one of the alleged thugs who stormed the venue of the meeting. The meeting was said to be in preparation for the forthcoming ward congress of the party. “They came in large number apparently with the intention to disrupt the meeting, and in the process, they started shooting, but the bullets hit one of the thugs,” a source said. The highly charged situation was eventually brought under control by a team of policemen, which was on patrol in the area at the time of the incident. At least one of the thugs has been arrested by the police, who also took the corpse of the deceased to a morgue. When contacted yesterday, the Delta Police Command spokeswoman, DSP Onome Onovwakpoyeya, confirmed the incident.
