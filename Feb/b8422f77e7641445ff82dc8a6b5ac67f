A criminal Court in Makka, Saudi Arabia has discharged and acquitted a Zamfara State-born death-row accused, Sheikh Ibrahim Ibrahim. Ibrahim, a renowned Islamic cleric, was allegedly accused of drug trafficking in Saudi Arabia and was on the death row. The Zamfara State Commissioner for Special Duties, Alhaji Mohammed Saddiq, told yesterday yesterday from Makka that the accused Ibrahim Ibrahim is a free man. Governor Bello Mohammed earlier met with President Muhammadu Buhari to intervene in the matter who in turn, instructed the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), Mr. Abubakar Malami. The commissioner explained: “It is evident that Ibrahim required the services of advocates which Governor Bello Mohammed swiftly handled by employing a team of lawyers for Ibrahim and constituted a delegation, including a lawyer representing the National Commission on Diaspora from the Federal Ministry of Justice, to Saudi Arabia to monitor the proceeding.” The commissioner said Ibrahim would be flown back to Nigeria to be reunited with his family.
