“In 2019, unlike other years, we don’t shout before airlines serve refreshments when there is flight delays. It is the same thing with refund. Once a flight is cancelled; unlike the past, the airlines will meet us and talk to us. That was not the case before. Complaints have come down drastically,” he said.
