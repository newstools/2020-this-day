Samuel Umtiti was in attendance at the Emirates Stadium on New Years Day to see Arsenal thrive under Mikel Arteta, who will be hoping the Gunners’ January target was impressed. The World Cup winner saw a revitalised Arsenal beat Manchester United 2-0, taking their first win under their new Spanish boss. One of Arsenal’s top priorities this month is signing a centre-back, and Umtiti would be a sensational addition if they can prise him away from Barcelona. Umtiti enjoyed the game from an executive box as he relaxed during the La Liga side’s winter break, with play in Spain set to resume on Saturday. Unfortunately for fans, the Frenchman almost certainly won’t be signing for Arsenal this window, as he focuses on chasing La Liga and Champions League success. Arteta will have to look elsewhere for centre-backs, and are chasing RB Leipzig defender Dayot Umapecano and Juventus’ Daniele Rugani. Umapecano is the preferred man, with the 21-year-old one of the hottest defensive prospects in Europe. An injury to Calum Chambers on Wednesday night intensified Arsenal’s need for a central defender, but the performances of man of the match David Luiz and goalscorer Sokratis – who have had miserable seasons up to now – were very encouraging.
