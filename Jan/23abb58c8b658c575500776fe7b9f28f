We welcome our new colleagues and Nigerian partners as we look forward to working together in this exciting phase of our development.” Addressing stakeholders at the meeting, Avuru said Seplat had positioned itself as an early mover through the acquisition of a 45 per cent operated interest in OMLs 4, 38 and 41 from Shell, Total and Agip in 2010, thus, becoming the first Nigerian independent to acquire a package of oil and gas blocks directly from the major international oil companies (IOCs) as part of a disposal process. Avuru explained that the company has demonstrated its ability to work its assets and produce its reserves despite external negative factors such as downtime and losses. “Seplat also began to invest in its gas business in 2010 in response to the Nigerian Government’s initiatives to improve the debilitating impact of poor power generation and supply in the country by opening the domestic supply obligation pricing to market forces,” he said.
