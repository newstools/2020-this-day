In a congratulatory message to Uzodinma which he personally signed, Senator Omo-Agege said, ”I join millions of Nigerians in congratulating you on your well-deserved electoral victory at the Supreme Court. “Your victory and that of the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) is a clear indication that no matter how long it takes, light will always prevail over darkness. “By reclaiming Imo State, I am optimistic that our party, the APC, will clinch more states not only in the South East geopolitical zone but also in the South-South in the 2023 governorship elections”. He commended Uzodinma for his steadfastness and unshaken belief in the judiciary, charging him to be focused in taking Imo State to the next level of economic prosperity in line with President Muhammadu Buhari administration’s policy.
