Market analysts said although Dangote Cement Plc remains the most capitalisation stock on the NSE, MTN might take over if the cement company decides to reduce its share through a share buy-back programme. Dangote Cement Plc has proposed to its shareholders to approve a share buy-back programme that will enable it buy 10 per cent of its paid-up shares. Going by the proposal, which is expected to be approved at an extra-general meeting (EGM) on January 22, Dangote Cement Plc will buy about 1,704,050,741 shares. These shares will be cancelled 10 days after acquisition. This will consequently reduce the outstanding shares of Dangote Cement to 15,336,456,664, from the current 17,040,507,405 shares. According to Dangote Cement, the programme is in line with the company’s corporate strategy to improved its return on equity, and shareholder value in order to future long term growth. “The relevant shares will be repurchased out of the profits of the company and any such number of shares bought under the programme is required to be cancelled in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and the NSE rule book which will consequently lead to a reduction in issued share capital,” the company said. Dangote Cement Plc has been adding value to shareholder value, paying dividend regularly. For instance, it paid N16 dividend per share for 2018 financial.
