Emmanuel Addeh in Yenagoa Antonio, the six-year-old son of the Bayelsa State Commissioner for Water Resources, Nengi Talbot, has been freed by his abductors after 16 days in captivity. It was unclear if any amount was paid before his release, but the police in the state claimed to have rescued the little boy without paying any ransom. Antonio was forcibly taken away on December 22 by four gunmen, who invaded the commissioner’s residence at the New Commissioners’ Quarters in Yenagoa, the state capital.

The state Commissioner of Police, Uche Anozia, who received the abductee at the command’s headquarters in Yenagoa, said the boy regained his freedom following sustained efforts of the police, who were on the trail of the kidnappers.

He explained that the police adopted high level of intelligence and professionalism to free the boy unhurt. According to him, all the suspects involved in the crime were arrested and would undergo further investigations for prosecution. In his comments, father of the victim commended the police for their efforts, stressing that the police never demanded any money throughout the period his ordeal lasted. The police commissioner, who said the father paid no ransom to get his son back, described the experience as traumatic.
