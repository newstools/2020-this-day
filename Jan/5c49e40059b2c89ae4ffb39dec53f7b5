Transfer Manchester United have agreed a deal to sign Portugal midfielder Bruno Fernandes from Sporting Lisbon. United will pay an initial fee of around 55m euros (£47m) for the 25-year-old, though add-ons could increase the overall cost to 80m euros (£67.6m). Fernandes’ move is subject to a medical and the agreement of personal terms. United have been in negotiations with Sporting throughout the transfer window but made a breakthrough on Tuesday amid reports of interest from Barcelona.
