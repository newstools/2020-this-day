A record $7.35bn (£5.6bn) was spent on transfers in men’s football during 2019, according to a report by world governing body FIFA yesterday. The figure is an increase of more than 5.8% on 2018 when it comes to transfers across the globe. English clubs spent £1.5bn, which was a 22.1% decrease from 2018 but still the most overall. There was a 16.3% rise in spending in the women’s games, to $652,032 (£497,000). The United States had the most players – at almost 20% – of the 833 transfers made in the women’s game. The were 18,042 such moves – also a record – in the men’s game, involving 15,463 players of 178 different nationalities. “It is remarkable to see a new record number of transfers in the men’s market,” said FIFA Chief Legal and Compliance Officer, Dr Emilio Garcia Silvero. “We observe, as well, increasing all-round figures in the women’s market, which is a sign of the positive overall development of women’s football over the last year which we trust will continue in 2020.”
