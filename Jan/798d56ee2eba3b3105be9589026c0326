A principal counsel in the Plateau State Ministry of Justice, Mr Gideon Azi, who is also holding brief for the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) in the case confirmed the new hearing date to THISDAY in Jos on Wednesday. Azi said: “The new judge, Justice Charity Dabup, who has been assigned by the Chief Justice of the state to take over the case has fixed January 21, 2020 to continue with the trial. “The new date is for mention. What this means is that the trial of the former governor and his co-accused will start afresh. Since we are on the side of the prosecution, we are making efforts to ensure that counsel to the two defendants are served with the hearing notice on the new date.” Jang is facing trial alongside and a former cashier in the office of the Secretary to the Plateau State Government, Mr. Yusuf Pam, as first and second defendants respectively. They were arraigned on a 17-count amended charge by the EFCC bordering on alleged misappropriation of fund and criminal breach of trust while serving as governor between 2007 and 2015. The duo had pleaded not guilty to the charges.
