According to the communique which was jointly signed by NCS President, Pro. Adesina Sodiya and the Executive Secretary of NCS, Mr. Iyola Ayola, the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (NDPR) Policy should be considered for implementation by a newly-created cyber security agency.

The communique also stressed that government should commence the process of flexible identification of citizens through data harmonisation, and that NCS must act further on its advocacy business through training and various seminars arrangement as a means of educating the public on the identified threats in the cyber space. The NCS was also urged to advise government to introduce a general course tagged “cyber security,” “at the entry level of our schools not only in the tertiary institutions but also at all levels of education, and at the same time, NCS must advise government on the need to outsource the activities of Nigeria Identity Management Commission (NIMC) to facilitate early completion of the project.”
