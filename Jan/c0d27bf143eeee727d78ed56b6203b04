The competition held in Obazu Autonomous Community, Mbieri in Mbaitoli Local Government Area of Imo State. Tournament’s top seed and women’s defending champion, Favour Chieke defeated hard fighting Joy Nwaiwu, 21-19, 21-11 to retain her title.

Having been favoured for the second time running by winning the title back-to-back to emerge the first and only player to achieve such feat in Obazu, Favour whose first sport is football, thanked the sponsor, Chief Nnamdi Iroegbu and his Marvico Group of Companies for helping her to discover her badminton talents by bringing the championship to Obazu.

Chief Iroegbu who gave out cash awards to both the winners and losers at the finals held to round off year 2019 activities, said the gesture was to encourage Obazu youths to take to sports knowing fully well that they can make good money from the sector. Chief Iroegbu promised that the third edition of the event will be bigger and better as other sport like table tennis may be added. The sponsor is envisaging turning the event into Mbaitoli Local Government Championship.
