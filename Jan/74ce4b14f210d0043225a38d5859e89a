The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has said the state government is committing N2 billion to the Edo Security Trust Fund as part of his administration’s resolve to strengthen security of lives and property in the state.  Obaseki, in a statement, said the fund will help strengthen security frameworks in the state ahead of the anticipated upsurge of socio-political activities in the state in 2020.  He said, “2020 will be another election year in Edo State. We will ensure that there is peace and security during the contestation. As part of our programme to ensure sustainable security, we have earmarked N2bn for the State’s Security Trust Fund.”  The governor added that the Security Trust Fund “will also raise funds from businesses and citizens to bolster the state government’s ability to protect and secure you more effectively.”  Obaseki noted, “Despite the provocation and hostility from quarters who should be interested and support the progress of our dear state, I solemnly pledge to uphold the people’s trust and continue to stand for our collective interest. As mortals, we will come, play our part and leave, but Edo will remain. My goal at the expiration of my tenure is that Edo State would have been propelled to the league of the best and most efficient sub-national entities not just in Nigeria, but in Africa.  “I want to assure you, fellow citizens, that we will not relent on our efforts at infrastructural renewal, industrialisation, and social development programmes which we are currently undertaking across the entire state.  We are committed to fixing our roads, rebuilding schools, facilitating expansion of existing businesses and ensuring a vibrant, boisterous state that we will all be proud to be associated with.”
