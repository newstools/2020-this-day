UEFA CHAMPIONS LEAGUE Manchester United’s season suffered a huge blow as a 3-2 defeat at German side RB Leipzig knocked them out of the Champions League. Needing just a draw to progress to the last 16, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side conceded twice inside 13 minutes to leave their hopes in tatters before RB Leipzig added what ultimately turned out to be the killer third with 20 minutes left. United staged their now customary second-half fightback thanks to a Bruno Fernandes penalty and Harry Maguire header, but ultimately fell short.
