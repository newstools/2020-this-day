By Vanessa Obioha Project submissions for the 2021 Durban FilmMart (DFM) are now open. The Durban Film Institute made the announcement Friday. “Our vision is to stimulate the growth of the African film industry through the development of film projects, and to network African filmmakers within the continent, and the rest of the world,” said Magdalene Reddy, acting General Manager of the Durban FilmMart Institute. “The success of the DFM over the years can be seen in the many independent film projects that have reached festivals as well as big and small screens, and the connections and relationships that have been developed and forged over the years.” Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 DFM took place as a virtual edition which attracted over 1,000 online delegates from 64 countries. These delegates represented producers, directors, scriptwriters, distributors, broadcasters, sales agents, financiers, investors, festival programmes and other film industry representatives from around the world. The Institute is hopeful that the 2021 edition will pool more numbers. The DFMI independent adjudication committee will select 10 feature-length documentaries and 10 feature-length fiction film projects from the submissions. These projects will undergo a two-day packaging and mentorship programme during the DFM, followed by one-on-one meetings with a panel of film financiers, buyers and distributors from across the globe. Full-length fiction and documentary film projects with Africans in the major creative roles (writers, directors, and producers) seeking co-producers, financiers, sales agents, and funders are invited to submit. These are read and reviewed by an adjudication committee for consideration. A producer and director must be attached to the project. The deadline for submission is February 21, 2021.
