Giving.ng, a reputable crowd-funding platform has been commended by Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG) alongside other partners such as Shell, Flour Mills and Nestle for supporting the recently concluded Nigeria Economic Summit (#NES26). The event which held between 23rd and 24th of November, 2020 had participants from private and public sectors discussing how strategic partnerships can be used as a tool to achieve economic growth. Speaking at the event, the Chief Executive Officer of NESG, Mr. Laoye Jaiyeola, lauded sponsors for their support. He said the NESG looks forward to more engaging and rewarding partnerships with reputable organisations such as Giving.ng, Banwo Ighodalo & Co, Shell, Flour Mills of Nigeria, Nestle Plc, among others. Explaining the rationale behind the theme, “Building Partnerships for Resilience,” Jaiyeola noted that, “There is a need to come together in partnership to revive the economy. Neither the government nor private sector alone can do it. Civil society alone cannot do it. “All segments of the economy need to come together to pool our resources to do it.” He added that although it would take time and patience, all players must be consistent at implementing the plans on a sustainable basis. The Chief Executive Officer of Sterling One Foundation, owner of Giving.Ng, Olapeju Ibekwe, in her reaction explained why her organisation supported the event. She said, “We decided to join hands together with NESG to mobilise available resources to ensure the speedy recovery of the economy. The aim and objectives of the summit are fully aligned with why Giving.ng was founded; that is why we decided that partnering with the NESG was an investment that would benefit the people of our country.”
