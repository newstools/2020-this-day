The Executive Vice Chairman of the Nigerian Communications Commission(NCC), Prof. Umar Danbatta, has dedicated his Zik Prize to the board, management and staff of the commission for their “collective and untiring commitment and efforts” in advancing the course of effective telecoms regulation in the country. While receiving the award in the professional leadership category at the annual Zik Prize 2020 organised by Public Policy Research and Analysis Centre (PPRAC) in Lagos, recently, Danbatta thanked the organisers for the honour, stating that the award was “a recognition for the entire commission.” “It is gratifying that our modest efforts at the Commission, especially since the coming on board of our leadership in 2015, are being recognised by the organisers of this prestigious award. I convey my profound gratitude to the organisers for counting me worthy of this award and we accept this gesture as a challenge to do more in digitally advancing our economy,” Danbatta responded after receiving the award. The award was attended by NCC board members, senior management and other staff of the Commission; aside other awardees in different categories as well as dignitaries from across the country. According to the citation, Danbatta was described as “a brilliant engineer, astute administrator, philanthropist and an outstanding nation builder who has brought his wealth of experience and remarkable regulatory finesse to bear as the country’s chief telecoms regulator.” Within a few years at the helm of affairs, Danbatta has embarked on many regulatory initiatives that have helped in transforming the NCC into a regulator of global acclaim through diligent implementation of the strategic 8-Point Agenda, which gave much-needed direction to the activities of the Commission. Also, “through several innovative initiatives, such as Subscriber Identification Module (SIM) registration and 112 Emergency Number, Danbatta has helped in the efforts towards stemming insecurity in the country. His efforts have sufficiently led to improvements in Quality of Service (QoS) delivery, broadband infrastructure deployment, broadband penetration, effective spectrum utilisation, consumer empowerment and technology innovation.”
