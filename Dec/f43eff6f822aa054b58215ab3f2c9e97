The BASPHCDA chairman added that efforts are on to ensure that the yellow fever outbreak did not spread to other LGAs in the state as well as neighbouring states of Kano and Jigawa. He said further that the vaccination for yellow fever will be conducted in 19 LGAs in the state with the exception of Alkaleri which had its vaccination in 2019 due to the outbreak there.
