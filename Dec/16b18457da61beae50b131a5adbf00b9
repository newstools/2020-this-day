By Adibe Emenyonu Kidnappers in Edo struck again yesterday when they abducted a commercial bus loaded with passengers. The gunmen were said to have attacked the Abuja-bound commercial bus travelling from Benin between Ehor and Iruekpen. Several of the passengers according to eyewitnesses, were forcibly taken into the bush by their abductors. Efforts to get police comment proved abortive as at press time yesterday, as no officials of the state police command could confirm nor deny the incident. Spokesman of the Edo State Police Command, Chidi Nwabuzor, a Superintendent of Police, did not respond to calls and SMS sent to his mobile phone.
