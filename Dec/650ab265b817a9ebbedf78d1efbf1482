The Chief Executive officer of Nigeria’s leading stadium construction outfit, Monimichelle, Ebi Egbe, has congratulated NFF President, Amaju Melvin Pinnick, on the occasion of his 50th birthday anniversary. Describing Amaju as an astute and cerebral football administrator, Egbe urged him to continue his good work as he strives to take Nigerian football to greater heights. Egbe while applauding Pinnick noted that he has done well both on the local and international scenes. The Monimichelle chief executive prayed for longer life and wisdom for Pinnick as he serves Nigerian football. He urged Nigerian football stakeholders to rally round and support him in his bid to become a member of the FIFA Council. “We must all set aside our differences and look at the bigger picture of a Nigerian, our own son being a member of FIFA Council. It is in the nation’s interest for us to support Pinnick to be in the pinnacle of world football administration,” Egbe said. Egbe noted that Pinnick has since becoming NFF president made Nigerian football a bigger brand. “All he needs is our support. We all can see that Pinnick has taken Nigerian football to the private sector. With less distractions our football would be taken to the height where we all want it to be,” Egbe concluded.
