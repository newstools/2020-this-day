By Udora Orizu The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, has described as shocking and painful the sudden death of the publisher of the Leadership Newspaper, Mr. Sam Nda-Isaiah. Gbajabiamila in a statement on Saturday, condoled with members of his immediate family, the management and staff of Leadership Newspaper, the Nigerian media industry, especially the Newspaper Proprietors’ Association of Nigeria (NPAN), over the loss. He said with Nda-Isaiah’s passing away, the Nigerian media industry had lost one of its committed pillars. He also said his death came at a time that the services of the media were needed most to promote unity among Nigerians as well as the development and growth of the country. While praying for the repose of the soul of late Nda-Isaiah, the Speaker said the late publisher would be remembered for contributing his quota toward Nigeria’s development through the media.
