MultiChoice streaming service Showmax recently launched a pop-up live stream of Africa Magic Yoruba in Nigeria. Fans of Yoruba movies can now watch their favourite Yoruba actors on the streamer. New blockbuster movies such as ‘Torera’, ‘Omo Williams’, ‘Kumapayi’, will be added every weeknight at 7 PM, while episodes of the beloved ‘Battleground’ (Yoruba version) will be aired every day at 6 PM. ‘Mr and Mrs Kogeregbe’ will start streaming on the platform from December 18 at 11:05 every weekday. Speaking about the addition of the pop-up live stream, Yolisa Phahle says, “We wanted to give our Nigerian subscribers even more value this December and a pop-up live stream of popular family channel Africa Magic Yoruba is ideal for the festive season.” “We have realised that technology and entertainment are two things that are important to our subscribers and that explains why, as we move into the festive season, we want our subscribers to enjoy their favourite Yoruba movies on the go from their various devices,” adds Channel Director, Wangi Mba Uzoukwu. The pop-up live stream of Africa Magic Yoruba follows the launch of live streams of Channels TV, NTAi and SilverbirdTV in November and the announcement of the first Showmax Nigerian Original, ‘I Am LAYCON’, which is currently filming in Nigeria and premieres in February 2021. Africa Magic Yoruba pop-up will be available throughout December and into the New Year.
