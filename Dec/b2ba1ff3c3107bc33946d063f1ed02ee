By James Sowole The Minister of Interior, Mr. Rauf Aregbesola, yesterday said the federal government had been working towards upgrading of Federal Fire Service (FFS) for optimum performance in fire fighting. The minister who disclosed that over 2,000 fire incidents had occurred across the country in 2020, said the federal fire service had been able to save 724 lives while assets worth over N1trillion were saved from being destroyed by fire by the fire service. Aregbesola stated this at the inauguration of a new multi-million naira fire-fighting truck, donated to Ondo State by the federal government, in Akure, the state capital. He said he was in the state to sensitise the people on the danger of fire. According to the minister, the fire was a good servant and dangerous master, warning the people to be careful of fire while handling items, particularly electrical appliances during the ongoing dry season. He said, “We are working towards upgrading the fire fighting services but our people must be careful and preventive against fire incidents. Because this is the most dangerous part of the year.” The minister expressed optimism that another fire fighting truck would be donated to the state in the first quarter of 2021, as a result of the collaboration between the state and his ministry. In his remarks, the Ondo State Governor, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu, said his administration had been making efforts to put the fire stations across the state in good condition and also motivate the fire officers. The governor said, “We are working hard and putting strategy in place to ensure all the fire stations are put in good shape within the shortest period of time to respond to emergencies as and when necessary. “To achieve this, it is our plan to acquire new Rapid Intervention Vehicles that convert water to vapour and can manoeuvre through narrow lanes and rough terrains for use by our firefighters.”
