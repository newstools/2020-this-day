By Alex Enumah The Federal High Court in Abuja yesterday upheld the Independent National Electoral Commission’s (INEC) decision deregistering the Alliance for United Nigeria, as a political party. Justice Ahmed Mohammed in a judgment held that INEC’s decision was “unassailable” as it was in line with the provision of section 225(a) of the Nigerian Constitution. The judge held that the AUN failed to meet the statutory threshold of the registration requirement for political parties. He held that having participated in the 2019 general elections and failed to win any seat in either federal, state, or local government levels INEC was right to deregister the party as stipulated in the constitutional provision.
