By Rebecca Ejifoma Residents of Lagos Monday besieged the office of the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) at Alausa Ikeja Lagos to register for the National Identity Number (NIN), flouting COVID-19 guidelines despite rising cases of infection. This development came after the Federal Government directed all telecommunications operators in the country to block all SIM cards without NIN registration after December 30 this year. Residents who thronged the Ikeja for the registration had no face masks on, and observed zero physical distancing. Meanwhile, the Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has cautioned Lagosians on the need to comply with the COVID-19 guidelines following the recent rise in cases of COVID-19. This led to the directive to reduce number of worshippers at religious centres, closure of schools, night clubs and other places to contain the spread of the disease. Despite these warnings, residents of Lagos Monday defied the governmentâ€™s guidelines to register for NIN over fear of being blocked by the telephone service providers.
