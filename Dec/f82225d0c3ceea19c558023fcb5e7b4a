By Vanessa Obioha MultiChoice Nigeria Wednesday announced the reward for the eventual winner of Nigerian Idol sixth season. The winner will be carting away a recording contract with a leading record label and N50 million worth of prizes which include a cash prize and a brand new car. “Our drive to empower talented Nigerian youth is at the forefront of our decision to return with Nigerian Idol. Nigerians are enormously talented in every sector and over the years, Nigerian music has been one of our greatest exports to the world and you can see how well the world has received Nigerian music,” said Chief Executive Officer of MultiChoice Nigeria, John Ugbe, in a statement. The prize announcement is coming barely two weeks after the media and entertainment company announced the return of the reality singing competition on Africa Magic with Season 6. The Idol franchise has over the years produced some of the biggest Nigerian singers such as Timi Dakolo, Mercy Chinwo and Omawumi who have gone ahead to carve out a niche for themselves in the global music scene. The online auditions for the new season started on Sunday, November 29, 2020, and will close on Sunday, December 13, 2020.
