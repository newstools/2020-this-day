By David-Chyddy Eleke The Inspector General of Police, Mr. Mohammed Adamu, has said that police would not tolerate another round of #EndSARS protest in the country. Adamu, who was in Anambra State to inspect the level of damage done on police facilities in the state, charged the police to nip such protest in the bud by resisting any attempt to attack government properties and police formations in the country. He said: “The officers and men (of the force) have been ordered to ensure that law and order are maintained in there various formations.” The Anambra State Commissioner of Police, Mr. John Abang, who led the IG round some of the affected facilities, said: “It was heart-rending when misguided miscreants and hoodlums suddenly launched vicious and murderous attacks on our personnel and facilities from the night of October 21, 2020 in Nnewi through to the evening of October 24, 2020 in Uli, mostly in Anambra South. “Regrettably, at the end of these callous attacks, the hoodlums had murdered four of our personnel and injured about 15 others.”
