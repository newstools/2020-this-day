Victor Osimhen and his Napoli teammates will be full of joy now as their Italian Serie A team have won an appeal at the Italian Olympic Committee (CONI) over a point deductionfor missing their game at Juventus last October. The clubs will now meet in a rearranged fixture after Juve were originally awarded a 3-0 win. The decisionsees Napoli move up to third in the table on the same number of points as the reigning champions. Napoli had two positive Covid-19 tests before the game and were ordered not to travel by their local health authority. However, Serie A refused to call the match off and Juve arrived at the stadium before kick-off without an opponent to face. Both Serie A and the Italian Football Federation said Napoli had not complied with agreed Covid-19 protocols, to ensure they could at least try to participate in the match. Napoli had two previous appeals rejected, before CONI decided in favour of the club on Tuesday.
