A former presidential aspirant, who ran on the platform of the Abundant Nigeria Renewal Party (ANRP), Chris Emejuru, has launched an eponymous non-governmental organization (NGO), Chris Emejuru Foundation. The foundation is Emejuru’s way of supporting the downtrodden in the society. According to the Nigerian-American, the foundation plans to alleviate poverty throughout the six geopolitical zones of Nigeria. According to him, “The plan is to alleviate Nigerians out of poverty throughout the six geo-political zones through water distribution and nutrition programmes, health, education, business opportunities, solar-powered electricity, and other services. We feel this is very urgent and necessary given the current situation in Nigeria, and we plan to begin operations next year.” A social activist, who recalled how the Lekki tollgate shooting further nudged his desires to establish the foundation, said that in solidarity with the Nigerian youth fighting for police reforms, he joined the protest at the Nigerian Embassy in Washington D.C, United States. Passionate about his course to effect change, he also noted that a better Nigeria can only be achieved through good leadership and a proper system of governance. He has an upcoming book detailing this vision for a better working Nigeria. “As a Nigerian American, I knew the significance of international pressure. Having travelled to Nigeria for over 15 years, knowing the ins and outs of business, philanthropy, and politics, I knew real change could only come from the patriotic voices both at home and abroad. That is why I have written a book that will be available in Nigeria soon and also why I support every Nigerian citizen who sacrifices to make our country better,” he concluded.
