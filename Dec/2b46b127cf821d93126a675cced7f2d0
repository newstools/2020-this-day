The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has said that the state government’s strategy to tackle the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic is to reduce the rate of spread and the disease death rate in the state. The governor, who said this in a statewide broadcast, noted that the government has reactivated isolation and treatment facilities and disease surveillance protocol to contain the spread of the virus in the state. According to him, “Even though we have created the capacity to respond to the new outbreak of COVID-19, our strategy to cope with the second wave is to decrease the incidence of the disease and decrease the mortality from the disease. “In order to decrease the number of COVID-19 cases and reduce deaths from this second wave, we must emphasis public enlightenment. As much as possible, you should avoid crowded places, closed places and close contact with other people.” Stressing the need for caution as residents in the state celebrate the yuletide season, he said, “We appreciate that during the yuletide period, there are normally a lot of interactions with family and friends, but unfortunately, we would have to sacrifice this old practice so that we can be alive to enjoy many more Christmases and year end activities in future.” He continued: “As we celebrate this season of love, we must be circumspect so as not to lose our loved ones. “In as much as government will enforce the rules relating to COVID-19 in Edo State, it is important that each and every one of us take personal responsibility to protect ourselves and the people around us. We must abide by all public health and safety measures to ensure that we are safe.”
