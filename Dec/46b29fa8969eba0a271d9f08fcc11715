Florence Aaron, Ekene Azubuike, and Ramila Shehu were recently presented with N1 million each in Kano State as part of the ongoing 9mobile Mega Millions Promo. The promo, which started in August, was said to have rewarded customers with the sum of N74 million and 3, 552 smartphones across the country. Speaking during the presentation event, the Manager of the 9mobile Experience Center in Kano, Abdullahi Ibrahim, congratulated the latest winners and stated that apart from the Mega Millions Promo, the telecommunication outfit is committed to delivering excellent services to customers. “Lots of happy customers have won either cash prices or smartphones in this promo, and we encourage more people to participate. At 9mobile, we design products and services with our customers in mind. “We have affordable internet services to help our customers communicate effectively. Our voice and internet tariffs are the most competitive and affordable in the market, and we constantly ensure that we meet our customers’ communication needs.” Aaron, an indigene of Kaduna State, said she stuck to 9mobile because she was not satisfied with her previous service provider. “I learned of the 9mobile Mega Millions Promo through different channels, but I never imagined that I would win one million Naira. I will invest my one million to my existing business to boost it. I appreciate 9mobile for this life-changing promo. It is real.” Similarly, Azubuike from the Sabon Gari area of Kano has been with the 9mobile brand since it commenced operations 12 years ago. He said, “I always recharge my 9mobile line every week with over two thousand naira for my business. So, when I received a call from 9mobile that I won, I thought it was scammers on the prowl. Now I can confirm that the promo is real.”
