Following the below par performance of his wards in the last AFCON 2022 qualifying matches against Sieria Leoone last month Super Eagles Head Coach, Gernot Rohr, has added Fulham defender, Tosin Adarabioyo to the list of growing ‘diaspora’ players in the team. The Franco/German tactician has been under intense criticism for overlooking the home grown players in preference of Nigerian players born abroad. According to www.owngoalnigeria.com, Rohr is determined to strengthen Eagles defence with the Fulham defender. Adarabioyo has represented England at several youth levels but not in any competitive game or tournament making his case of wanting to switch allegiance to Nigeria a lot easier than it’s supposed to be. It usually takes around a year to get clearance from FIFA for English youth internationals willing to switch allegiance but Adarabioyo’s case isn’t expected to be that complicated as it is similar to that of Alex Iwobi. Iwobi only needed to prove that the games he played for England youth teams were not competitive games before FIFA allowed his switch to go on, same could happen with Adarabioyo. ” I know Rohr likes him a lot and was delighted when he accepted the chance to play for Nigeria but he still need some form of clearance from FIFA to make it happen. He loves the Super Eagles as well “, a source told Owngoalnigeria .com. “‘ If all goes as planned he will play for Super Eagles in March. He is one of the four players who will be added to the team to help them in cementing a spot at the AFCON and also start the qualifiers for the World Cup 2018”.
