As Canada’s government released the 2020 report on immigration plans to her parliament on immigration matters that would pave the way for millions of migrants to migrate to the country, ALTEC Global Inc., a Toronto-based Immigration Law and Business consulting firm, has commenced a move to facilitate regular migration, especially for Africans. The facilitation will favour ambitious business men, graduates, families, skilled and various types of workers to relocate to Canada by availing them adequate information on specific areas of interests and visa categories. The Chief Executive Officer of ALTEC, Susan Gong, confirmed that the firm is ready to assist persons who wish to live, work or study in Canada with a team of experts that has combined experience of over 25 years in immigration services to individuals and families. Vouching for the company’s credibility and competence during an exclusive interview in Nigeria, the President of Journalists International Forum For Migration (JIFORM), Ajobola Abayomi, said the firm is reputable for quality services on immigration matters. “With the interaction we have had with members of the ALTEC that comprised Gerry Weiner, former Canada Immigration Minister and Susan, these people are genuine and are offering services to regular migrants by helping them to achieve their goals. In 2021, JIFORM is looking for a working arrangement that will facilitate capacity building and other technical exchange programmes for journalists in Canada,” he said. Gong, a former board member of the Immigration and Refugee Board, brings her experience and knowledge as a Chartered Accountant and business owner with Gerry Weiner, James Metcalfe, a former Canadian Consul and Visa Officer, Zacheaus Somorin, the North America Coordinator of JIFORM and former Diplomatic Correspondent with THISDAY Newspapers Nigeria, Immigration Law/Consultant graduate, and others as members of ALTEC Global Inc. Canada has over 100 immigration programmes; offering a wide range of opportunities by which persons can immigrate to the country either as temporary residents with permission to work or study or become permanent residents. ALTEC works with a leading law firm in Montreal, Canada to provide assistance to clients that are destined to the Quebec region in the country among others.
