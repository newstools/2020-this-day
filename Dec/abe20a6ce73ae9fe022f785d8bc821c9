Notes for File There was a certain piece of good news that many practically bypassed in the week, either intentionally or by default. Although the many collective challenges of the nation might have been largely responsible for the oversight, it is however worth giving not just a mention but serious attention for further considerations. A certain young man by name, Paschal Ishiagwo, trended on the social media, albeit insufficiently, as having manufactured a noiseless rechargeable power generating set in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, that could last about 10 hours. The interesting thing is that Paschal, who is said to live in Ahoada, Rivers State, is just a secondary school graduate, who is still seeking admission into a higher institution and perhaps, yet to have a clear cut vision what the future looks like. This is the kind of direction the Minister of Science and Technology, Ogbonnaya Onu, should be looking at as against seeking to produce pencils in 21st century. Paschal needs encouragement. He needs to be put in the path to national development. He needs to be assisted to grow right and early in his life. Indeed, Paschal deserves all the commendations. Kudos, young man!
