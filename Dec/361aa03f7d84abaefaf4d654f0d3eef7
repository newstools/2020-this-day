Chuks Okocha in Abuja The Chairman of the Senate Committee on Appropriation, Senator Barau Jubrin, yesterday disclosed that the National Assembly has transmitted the 2021 Appropriation Bill to President Muhammadu Buhari for his assent. The two chambers of the National Assembly had last Monday passed the appropriation bill which is to the tune of N13,588,027,886,175 as an aggregate expenditure. The passage of the appropriation bill was done during an emergency session convened for the purpose of passing the budget. The approved budget figure by the National Assembly comprises: total Capital Supplementation of N1,060,751,051,650 and total Capital Expenditure of N4,125,149,354,222, Statutory Transfer stands at N496,528,471,273; Recurrent Expenditure of N5,641,970,060,680 and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate of three per cent. The passed budget bill by the National Assembly also provided the sum of N3,324,380,000 trillion for debt servicing. According to the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Appropriation, Senator Barau Jubrin, “the harmonised version of the Senate and House of Representatives of the 2021 budget has since been transmitted to the appropriate quarters at the presidency. “As far as the National Assembly is concerned, we have transmitted the 2021 budget to the appropriate quarters. We don’t know when it would be signed into law,” he said. Also, Senator Barau Jubrin said that he is not in the know if the presidency is raising any objection to the budget bill as passed by the National Assembly. Reminded that the year is almost gone, the Senate Committee Chairman on Appropriation said: “It could signed any time, we cannot dictate to them when the budget bill will be signed into law.” It is not clear whether the increase of the budget bill by N505,607,317,942 by the National Assembly would be acceptable to the executive arm of government as it is in the habit of, in most cases, refusing approval, insisting on amendments. The presidency has between Monday to Thursday to sign the budget bill into law to effectively give it the January to December authority. The budget estimate was increased by the sum of N505,607,317,942 from the estimate of N13,082,420,568,233 presented to the joint sitting of National Assembly by President Muhammadu Buhari on October 8, 2020.
