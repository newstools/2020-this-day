By Udora Orizu Members of the House of Representatives were divided at Tuesday plenary on whether or not to invite President Muhammadu Buhari to appear before them and offer explanation on the security situation of the country. Moving a motion on behalf of other 10 Borno State lawmakers on the floor, Hon. Satomi Ahmed prayed the President to amongst others things, declare a state of emergency on security matters. The motion is coming on the heels of the massacre of over 43 rice farmers in Zabarmari village, Jere Local Government near Maiduguri, in Borno State over the weekend by Boko Haram insurgents. However, Hon. Ahmed Jaha, from Borno moved a point of order on matter of privilege, saying that the motion jointly moved by all Borno lawmakers in the house had been watered down as the prayer to invite the President for explanations on the state of security in Nigeria was no longer there, insisting that it should be the major prayer. His amendment got the support of the House. But the Speaker of the House, Femi Gbajabiamila, and the majority leader of the House, Hon. Ado Doguwa,
said it was not necessary, noting that security issues can’t be discussed openly. They pleaded for the understanding of their colleagues not to summon the president. Their contributions were however greeted with shouts of Noooooo, from majority of the lawmakers. The point of order degenerated into a rowdy session forcing the speaker to dissolve the House into an executive session. Details later….
