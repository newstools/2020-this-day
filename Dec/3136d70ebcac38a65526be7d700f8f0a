Chuks Okocha in Abuja Former National Publicity Secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Chief Olisa Metuh, has been released from Kuje prisons following the court judgment that upturned his conviction. THISDAY gathered that Metuh left the prison about 4.46pm. on Thursday. Metuh was joyful, according to one his close aides who spoke with THISDAY after he left the correctional faciility at Kuje where he had been held since February 25, 2020. “Yes, Oga has just left about two minutes ago,” one of Metuh’s aides told THISDAY. He was seen off by the FCT Comptroller of Correctional Facilities and the head of Kuje Correctional Facility. Metuh was sentenced by Justice Okon Abang to seven-year imprisonment on the allegation of money laundering on February 25, 2020. However, the Court of Appeal penultimate Wednesday quashed his conviction on the basis of bias established against Justice Abang. The court also sent the case for retrial with a specific instruction that it should not be assigned to Justice Abang. Metuh had in the course of his trial under Justice Abang repeatedly alleged bias against the judge but his appeals were dismissed by the court, leaving him to head to the Court of Appeal which sufficiently established the bias against Justice Abang.
