The nation’s capital number one frontline health worker against the dreaded virus confirmed her status in a a video she shared online yesterday. Okechukwu said she came down with the virus last Friday after having a 24-hour symptoms. Her result came out positive and is presently admitted in one of the isolation centres in the FCT. In her message, she urged FCT residents to be careful as COVID-19 cases are on the rise in the territory going by the new cases that health workers are identifying recently. “In the past two weeks, coronavirus cases have been on the increase in the FCT. It does not matter what people think about it or what their beliefs are, the truth is that COVID 19 is real and is very fertile and many people are dying without being diagnosed with the sickness. I am now a victim and I want everybody to know that all we are doing is just to make people safe,” Okechukwu said. She raised the alarm that people are no longer adhering to the use of face mask and social distancing, warning that such an attitude will not help as in the next couple months as it is likely to be an escalation of the COVID-19 crisis in FCT. “Everybody should play safe and start wearing face marks as we go into the festive period. We need to help ourselves because from what we are seeing now, many people are coming up with the virus. “Unfortunately, I have been wearing my facemasks and doing what I ought to do but I don’t know how I got the virus and the person through whom I got it. But I thank God I survived the crisis and have a positive feeling that I will come out alive. We should all play safe”.
