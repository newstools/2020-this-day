Kidnappers in Edo struck again Tuesday when they hijacked a commercial bus with passengers. The ‎gunmen were said to have attacked the Abuja-bound commercial bus traveling from Benin between Ehor and Iruekpen. Several of the passengers, according to eyewitnesses, were forcefully taken into the bush‎ by their abductors. Efforts to get police reaction proved abortive as at the time of filing this report, as no official of the state Police Command could confirm nor deny the incident. Spokesman of the E‎do State Police Command, Chidi Nwabuzor, a Superintendent of Police, did not respond to calls and SMS sent to his mobile phone.
