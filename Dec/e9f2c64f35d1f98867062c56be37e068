The Enugu Electricity Distribution PLC (EEDC) has cautioned its customers as well as the general public against indiscriminate bush burning and acts capable of causing fire outbreak, as the harmattan season sets in. This call was made by the Head, Corporate Commission, EEDC, Mr. Emeka Ezeh, in a statement made available to THISDAY.
“Fire outbreaks have been identified as one of the common risks facing EEDC, especially during the harmattan season”. As a result of this, EEDC is reminding her customers of the need to be cautious during this period. According to Ezeh, EEDC has commenced public sensitization of her customers across its network, using the electronic mass media and digital platforms. The harmattan season is synonymous with dry wind, which makes it very easy for fire to spread, thereby causing destruction of lives and property. “Our major concern is those in the rural communities that engage in hunting activities, who usually set the bush on fire. We appeal that even if they must engage in such, which they should exercise caution and do so in a well-coordinated manner, to avoid causing damage to our installations located within their environment”. The distribution company used the opportunity to encourage customers not to take any electrical spark in their homes lightly, as they could lead to fire outbreak. They are advised to always engage the services of competent and qualified electricians in carrying out electrical repairs. “Overloading of electrical sockets is also identified as a potential cause of fire outbreak and customers are advised to desist from such act”, Ezeh added.
