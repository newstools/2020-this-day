The two guests on the programme are Ghanaian photographer and filmmaker, Carlos Idun-Tawiah, and Brian Otieno, a photo-journalist from Kenya.
Idun-Tawiah, a graduate of the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Accra, Ghana, is reputed as one of the best contemporary photographers and filmmakers whose expertise is currently putting the country positively on the world map. He is at present the Lead Partner at Lightning Pathways Company, an umbrella convergence of gifted practitioners of the art of photography. The talented photographer was one of five next-generation designers and photographers contracted earlier in the year by Mercedes-Benz to showcase Ghana’s emerging talent and thatcountry’s tradition of sharing skills from one generation to the next through storytelling with their peculiar skills.
