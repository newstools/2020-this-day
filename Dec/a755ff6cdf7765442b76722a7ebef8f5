By Adibe Emenyonu A retired Chief Superintendent of Police, Carol Afegbai, has dragged the Edo State Judicial Panel of Inquiry on Police Brutality and other related abuses before a Benin-City High Court, to challenge its right to compel her to appear before it. The judicial panel on December 1, 2020, ordered the immediate arrest of Afegbai for failing to appear before it to explain her alleged complicity in the murder of a 500 level student of the University of Benin, Ibrahim Momodu, in 2013. The panel was of the view that the respondent, having failed to appear before it, a warrant of arrest should be issued compelling her to appear before the panel. “Accordingly, it is hereby ordered that a warrant of arrest be issued forthwith on the said respondent, Carol Afegbai, who shall appear before this panel following the order of this panel on December 9, 2020,” Chairman of the panel, Justice Ehigiamusoe, said. However, at the resumed hearing, Justice Ehigiamusoe told counsel to the family of late Ibrahim Momodu, Jefferson Uwoghiren, that they (panel) had been served a court paper from the High Court restraining them for inviting CSP Afegbai before it. Ehigiamusoe said the panel would honour the summon to show to other Nigerians that they have respect for the judicial system of the country. Responding, counsel to the late Momodu’s family, Uwoghiren, described the action of Afegbai as an ambush, noting however that he was not served the court application.
