By Ibrahim Shuaibu Kano State House of Assembly yesterday approved the request of the state Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, to access the N20 billion internal facility. The loan is to be sourced from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and United Bank for Africa (UBA). Presenting Ganduje’s letter of request before the plenary, Speaker of the Assembly, Abdulazeez Garba-Gafasa, disclosed the intention of the government to secure the Assembly’s consent to access the loan. According to the Speaker, Ganduje is seeking the loan to cover financial liability occasion by the COVID-19 pandemic. After deliberation, the lawmakers unanimously considered the request and approved the facility. Speaking with journalists after the plenary, Majority Leader, Kabiru Hassan-Dashi, explained that the Assembly considered the governor’s request after the state government failed to access the capital market loan due to present economic conditions. Meanwhile, during the plenary, a member representing Kunchi/Tsayawa constituency, Garba Ya’u-Gwarwai, apologised to the Assembly on behalf of the five suspended members. The five lawmakers were suspended by the Assembly for allegedly instigating a rowdy session that prevented the Assembly’s intervention in the removal of the deposed Emir Muhammad Sanusi. A Federal High Court in Kano has ordered the reinstatement of the lawmakers.
