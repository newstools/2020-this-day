By Vanessa Obioha It’s the final day of Arise Fashion Week 2020 and the remaining 10 designers will be having their designs displayed on the runway, with the hope to get a spot on the grand finale. Twenty designers walked the runway last night displaying sophisticated creativity and culture. Opening the show Saturday night is Ré Lagos. Not a newcomer on the Arise Fashion Week runway, the collection was a mix of bold and colourful patterns. Fruché, the next designer, brought superb chicness on the catwalk, playing with different fabrics that showcased her wrapping techniques and cuts. The fringe footwears and the toy cars earrings were also unmissable.
