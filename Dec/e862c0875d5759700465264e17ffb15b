By Francis Sardauna Bandits on Monday night kidnapped the village Head of Kaigar Malamai, Kabir Muhammed Ajiya, his two wives and 14 other peasant farmers in Danmusa Local Government Area of Katsina state. The bandits were said to have also ransacked the entire village, injuring six other persons and rustled unspecified cows in the village. A survivor of the attack, Umar Abdulsalam, who spoke to THISDAY in a telephone interview on Tuesday, said the villagers had relocated to Dan-Musa town and other nearby villages in the local government. THISDAY reports that bandits had earlier kidnapped 80 pupils of Hizburrahim Islamiyya School in Mahuta village of Dandume Local Government Area of the state but were rescued by a team of security operatives. He said, “yesterday (Monday) at about 9pm some armed Fulani people riding on motorcycles attacked our village. They took away our village head, Malam Kabir Muhammed Ajiya, and his two wives. “They also kidnapped 14 other people, including the wives of Kabir’s younger brothers and their children and injured many other people who were trying to escape the attack”. Abdulsalam added: “We have reported the attack to the police in the area and they (police) had visited the scene of the attack and are currently in the bush with some vigilantes in search of the abducted victims”. He expressed concern that the bandits were yet to contact the community to know the whereabouts of the victims, particularly women and children among them. He lamented the spate of killings, kidnapping and other nefarious activities afflicting communities in Dan-Musa local government, saying kidnapping remains daily occurrence in the area. When contacted, the Spokesman of the Katsina State Police Command, SP Gambo Isah, promised to investigate the incident and get back to journalists later.
