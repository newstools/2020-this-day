Ghana’s President Nana Akufo-Addo has won re-election with 51.59 percent of the vote, results from the election commission showed on Wednesday. Akufo-Addo emerged winner of the contentious poll that he and his main challenger, former president John Mahama, had said they were leading based on their camps’ tallies. According to Aljazeera reports, five people were killed in election violence since Monday, marring what observers said was a well-organised vote. The Ghanaian Police Service said it recorded more than 60 incidents at Monday’s vote, adding that “Twenty-one of the incidents are true cases of electoral violence, six of which involve gunshots resulting in the death of five.” . Independent observers had earlier congratulated Ghana for conducting largely peaceful poll, in line with its reputation as one of West Africa’s most stable democracies. But tensions are high as the camps of Mahama and Akufo-Addo said their tallies showed their candidate in the lead.
