It is a battle of Nigeria wingers at Club Brugge and it appears David Okereke will start ahead of Emmanuel Dennis for the Belgian champions in tonightâ€™s must-win UEFA Champions League tie at Lazio. Club Brugge have to win at Lazio Tuesday night so as to advance to the Round of 16 of the Champions League and not play in the UEFA Europa League. At the weekend, Okereke replaced his teammate and compatriot to become the match winner against Sint-Truiden.
