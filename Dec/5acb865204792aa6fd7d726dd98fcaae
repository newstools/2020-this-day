By Sunday Okobi One of the Nigeria’s leading security companies, Halogen Group, has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Nigerian Global Business Forum (NGBF) for the provision of security services and solutions in Nigeria to all members of the forum from all parts of the world. Through the partnership, NGBF, the official body that operates as an umbrella organisation for Nigerian Business Forums across the globe, seeks to leverage on the strengths and deep experience of Halogen to foster sustainable protective services, risk advisory services and end-to-end safety enabling solutions in Nigeria, for its members worldwide. Speaking at the MoU signing ceremony recently, which took place virtually in recognition of the COVID-19 pandemic, leaders of both organisations highlighted the strategic significance of the collaboration for Nigeria’s economic development, “especially in view of the boost in confidence that Halogen security solutions bring to an increasing number of Nigerians in Diaspora who nurses a deep desire to establish businesses in Nigeria but who are often dismayed by widely reported insecurities.” <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-473306" src="https://i0.wp.com/storage.googleapis.com/thisday-846548948316-wp-data/wp-media/d5429b4a-wale-aloye.jpg?resize=300%2C280&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="280" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Group CEO of Halogen, Mr. Wale Olaoye, while expressing the company’s delight about being named as NGBF’s preferred security organisation, stated that Halogen sees its involvement in the provision of a safety-enabling framework for Nigerians from the Diaspora as a patriotic cause that stands to significantly strengthen Diaspora investors’ confidence. Olaoye, who elaborated on the multi-faceted nature of Halogen’s security solutions, explained that “the world biggest multinational investors in Nigeria have a long and deep history of relying on Halogen security services, ranging from physical security and mobility; cyber security and electronic remote surveillance; background check, investigations to security training,” expressing delight that Nigerians from Diaspora will now have the opportunity to discover quality Halogen services which their multinational counterparts have long enjoyed. Speaking also at the MoU signing virtual event, Chairman of the Board of NGBF, Afolabi Andu, and President of Nigeria Irish Business Forum, Princess Pamela Ogunwusi, who also graced the event, commended Halogen for its deep and diversified security offerings and its long track record of leadership within the Nigerian security sector which motivated the partnership.
