Mary Nnah Polo Luxury has collaborated with Cartier to unveil the highly anticipated Pasha De Cartier watch. The French luxury watch and jewelry brand established its presence in Nigeria over 10 years ago, through their exclusive partnership with Polo Luxury Group. To mark the arrival of the latest Cartier collection in Nigeria, Polo Luxury organised an exclusive showcase in their flagship store, with some of the collectors and friends of the brand in attendance. The prestigious activation was specifically curated to suit Polo’s clients’ desires by providing a respite for shoppers and a luxury watch haven for enthusiasts and VIP clients. This Pasha De Cartier collection presents an upgraded take on the established 1975 edition. The timepieces are available in steel and gold, and full gold, with some versions set in diamonds. The design features a winding crown set with blue sapphire. The watch was first designed in 1985, 35 years later, it still retains its initial magic.
