Last December 21, 2019, witnessed a wedding of the year when former FCT Minister of State, Chuka Odom, gave his medical doctor first daughter in marriage to a Delta State-born medical doctor based in the United States of America. Come December 28, 2020, the Odoms will host a traditional wedding ceremony for their second daughter, Jessica Odom, a Queen Mary University of London LLM (Distinction) and LLB University of Reading (Second Class Upper) at his country home in the Imo State Capital, Owerri suburb of Ikeduru. The people of Ikeduru and Okene in Kogi State will gather on that December date to consummate the union according to Igbo traditional marriage rites, long before the church wedding comes up in April 2021.
The event promises to be a classic trad, as the youth would describe it, but it will also be a wedding of cultural dimension when you think of the rich cultural traditions of the Igbo and the Ebira. It will be a confluence of the cultural diversity of the two peoples and will be quite a significant outing called ‘wine carrying’ in Igbo tradition (Igba Nkwu). Not only will the legal community converge on Ikeduru in their numbers, as the two parents and Jessica come from there, but so too will be the digital people who will be there to honour one of their own. It will be a rare outing for the people of Imo and Kogi because Gabriel and Jessica will be out to showcase their social groups and ultimately add colour and vivacity to the event. Retired Justice Moses Bello was the President of the Customary Court of Appeal, Abuja while Odom is a legal luminary, businessman, and politician. Gabriel and Jessica’s intimidating CVs include skills in organization and leadership, legal analysis, business planning, and execution.
