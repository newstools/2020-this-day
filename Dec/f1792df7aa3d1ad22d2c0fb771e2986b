By Omololu Ogunmade President Muhammadu Buhari Friday commiserated with the family, friends and associates of Nigeria’s out-going Ambassador to the United States, Justice Sylvanus Adiewere Nsofor, who passed on at the age of 85. Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, in a statement, said the president, in a telephone call to Jane, the widow of the retired justice in New York on Friday, described Nsofor as “an outstanding judge of rare courage and truth who is not afraid to give justice to whom justice is due.” According to the statement, the president was apparently referring to the 2003 presidential election petitions on which Nsofor delivered a minority judgment as a member of the election appeal tribunal in his favour as the candidate of the All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP). Buhari said the country would miss people with such exemplary pedigree. The statement added that Buhari directed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work with Nsofor’s family on the burial arrangements, prayed God to comfort all who mourn the departed jurist and grant his soul eternal rest.
