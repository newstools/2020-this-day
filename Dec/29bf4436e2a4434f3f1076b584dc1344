Michael Olugbode in Maiduguri The National Leader of All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Bola Tinubu, said the party cannot afford to be disunited because it has a destiny to put Nigeria right. Tinubu, who led some party men to Maiduguri to pay condolence on the government and people of Borno State on recent killing of rice farmers by Boko Haram at Zabarmari rice field, said “any remaining rats and cockroaches should be sprayed out of the party.” He added that the party must live to its symbol, the broom which signifies the importance of unity and work to take out any form of disunity. The APC leader said the covenant of APC with the Nigeria people is to work together in unity to bring about development and progress and that they must work for at all times. He insisted that there is unity in the party, noting that anything that would however work contrary to the progress of the party and Nigeria should be weeded out. On the purpose of their visit to Borno State, Tinubu said it should be seen not “as a condolence visit only, not only as a sympathy visit but as a solidarity and commitment that we must defeat all evil doers. “To show solidarity to the governor of Borno State, who is a man of courage, brilliance, talent and great character.” He said that conceited effort should be put in place to get urchins off the street by investing in their future. He noted that street urchins are easy recruits to violence monger and those who do not mean well for the nation. Tinubu also called for the involvement of technology to curb the spate of violence across the country. Responding, Borno State Governor, Prof. Babagana Zulum commended the former Lagos Governor for the visit.
