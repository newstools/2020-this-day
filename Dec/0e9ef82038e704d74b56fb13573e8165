Super Eagles goalkeeper, Ikechukwu Ezenwa, was simply in cloud nine when his club, Heartland played out a goalless draw with Remo Stars in a pre-season friendly in Ikenne, Ogun State on Wednesday. Ezenwa was thrilled beyond words by the hybrid geotech turf at the Ikenne home of Remo Stars built by Nigeria’s leading stadium construction outfit, Monimichelle. Immediately after the game, Ezenwa described the pitch simply as world-classed. He therefore urged NPFL clubs and the various state governments to partner Monimichelle as a way of having state-of-the-art pitches across the country. “If we have this kind of pitch at all the league venues, fans would see the best of Nigerian club football. What we have here in Ikenne is the same with what the same company constructed for Enyimba in Aba. “I played for Enyimba and I know the Enyimba Stadium in Aba boasts of one of best pitches in the country. I want to see this kind of pitch in Owerri and I would plead that other states should partner Monimichelle. He is doing a damn good job with playing turfs he has constructed in the country. Ezenwa stressed that those who want the nation’s domestic league to grow must think first of the playing surface. “When you play on a good pitch, you are able to express yourself better. This is why I am drumming my support for Monimichelle. Since this is an indigenous company with the right expertise there is need to get him construct this lush green turfs all over the country…that is the way to go,” Ezenwa said, adding, “I know what I m talking about because this turf here in Ikenne is not the same with the conventional artificial turfs which we (the players) would ordinarily not want to play on,” concludes the Eagles goalkeeper.
