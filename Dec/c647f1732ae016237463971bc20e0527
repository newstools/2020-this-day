Officials of the Lagos State and Rescue Service have been attacked by suspected hoodlums at the Agege area of Lagos State. Three firemen were injured, according to a statement issued yesterday by the acting head of the agency, Mrs. Margaret Adeseye. The statement was titled ‘hoodlums attack Lagos firemen, destroy fire engine’. Adeseye explained that a fire engine belonging to the Agency damaged by hoodlums, who attacked the officials in the course of duty on Sunday. She expressed displeasure over the “incessant attacks on firefighters in recent times for yet to be identified reasons”. She recalled that the attack on the firefighters and the engine occurred after officials of the agency were prevented from attending to a fire incident at Nmani Street, Dopemu Agege, in Orile Agege LCDA, Lagos. “Three firemen from a crew of four were injured and the Agency’s vehicle, Agege Fire Eagle C07, damaged by the hoodlums after preventing the personnel from performing their official duties in October. “It took the intervention of a team of policemen from Alabo Police Division, led by Supol Bako Muhammed, before normalcy was restored at the fire scene,” Adeseye added. She noted that the injured officers were treated at Agege General Hospital, while “investigations about the incident are ongoing to effect the arrest of culprits and ascertain the cause of the attack”.
