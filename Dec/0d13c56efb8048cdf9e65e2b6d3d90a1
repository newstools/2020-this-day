Chuks Okocha in Abuja The Chief Whip of the Senate and former Governor of Abia State, Dr. Orji Uzor Kalu, has endorsed former Nigerian Ambassador to the United States, Prof George Obiozor, as the candidate for Ohanaeze Ndigbo president-general. This is even as the Abia North senator called on Ime Obi Ohanaeze Ndigbo, the organisation’s highest organ, to adopt Obiozor as its consensus candidate. In a statement signed by Emeka Nwala of the Office of the Senate Chief Whip, Kalu said he had made wide consultations with the Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige; Minister of Science and Technology, Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu; Governor of Enugu State, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi; Ebonyi State Governor, Dave Umahi; Governor of Anambra State, Chief Willie Obiano; Imo State Governor, Senator Hope Uzodimma; former Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu; former Secretary to Government of the Federation (SGF), Senator Anyim Pius Anyim; Deputy Chief Whip of the House of Representatives, Rt. Hon Nkeiru Onyejeocha; Senator Ben Obi, and other Igbo leaders in National Assembly, and pleaded with them for their full support for Obiozor He said Ohanaeze Ndigbo needed a non-partisan technocrat as its leader to steer its leadership, stating that Obiozor possesses all the qualities needed to revive Ohanaeze Ndigbo. According to him, “Ohanaeze is the authentic voice of the Igbo people, which exists for the sole purpose of speaking for and representing the interest of Ndigbo since its inception in 1976. It is expected to be non-partisan. We need a leadership that can rightly define and defend the interests of Ndigbo. “I have known Professor Obiozor for a long time, and I am confident he will competently lead an active, mature, hardworking and viable Ohanaeze Ndigbo organisation,” he said. Kalu also urged all Abia delegates to vote for Obiozor for the betterment of Ohanaeze and growth of Ndigbo.
