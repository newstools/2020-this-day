By Laleye Dipo Niger State workers on Wednesday grounded government activities following the resumption of an indefinite strike by organized labour in the state. The industrial action is as a result of the state government’s decision to slash workers salaries by 30 per cent. As a result of the action, all government offices, including the state secretariat, the general hospital and the water board have been put under lock and keys. Officials of the organized labour were also seen moving round to enforce the strike. However, commercial banks and other private businesses were seen operating without any molestation. The Commissioner for Information, Alhaji Mohammed Sani Idris, when contacted, appealed to the workers to call off the strike in the interest of the state. Idris, who spoke through his Technical Adviser, Mr Ilya Garba, urged workers to understand the situation the state had found itself, saying the salary cut though painful is “desirable if the state is to move ahead”. “The whole thing is a temporary measure. Immediately the economy improves, refunds will be made,” he said. However, labour has insisted that there is no going back until government meets all its demands. In the meantime, labour is planning an interdenominational prayer for Thursday for divine intervention in the matter.
