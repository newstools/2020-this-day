President Muhammadu Buhari is billed to meet with the 344 Kankara schoolboys any moment from now.
The schoolboys were abducted by gunmen from their hostels at the Government Science Secondary School, Kankara, Katsina State last Friday.
The schoolboys who were held captive in the forest in Zamfara State regained their freedom Thursday night and were brought back to Katsina where they were received by Governor Aminu Masari Friday morning.
They are currently gathered at a hall awaiting the arrival of President Buhari who has been in Daura, Katsina state on a one-week private visit. Details laterâ€¦
