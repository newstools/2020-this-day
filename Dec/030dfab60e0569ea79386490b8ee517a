Femi Solaja with agency report Former Super Eagles forward, Victor Moses, is in his final months as a Chelsea player following the decision of the London club to offload him along with six other players in next summer transfer maket. The current manager Frank Lampard has made it clear that the Nigerian player on loan at Inter Milan and the six other players have no future again at the club. UK’s The Sun reported that Antonio Rudiger, Marcos Alonso, Andreas Christensen, Ross Barkley and Jorginho and Danny Drinkwater are all closer to the exit door at Stamford Bridge. The London tabloid reported that the coach planned to reduce the squad to make way for the expected expensive signings in the coming major transfer market next June. Moses has been a journeyman in the last four seasons after been loaned to several clubs in Europe including presentInter Milan, Liverpool, Stoke City, West Ham and Fenerbache. It is still not clear if the Nerrazuri would be willing to pay the £10million initial tag on the wing back when they meet with the parent club at the end of the season. Moses is currently been used sparingly by the Italian club who are one point behind city rival, AC Milan on log and aiming to topple Juventus who have won the title for nine consecutive seasons. Victor Moses joined Chelsea way back in 2012.
