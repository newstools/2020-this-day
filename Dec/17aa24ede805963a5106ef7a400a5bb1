Wilfred Ndidi returned to Leicester City’s starting lineup as they registered a 2-0 home win over AEK Athens in the Europa League on Thursday night. Manager Brendan Rodgers has been able to include the Nigeria international in his matchday squad for the last three games in all competitions after fully recovering from an adductor injury that required surgery. That injury forced Ndidi to miss thirteen straight games before making a comeback against Zorya Lugansk on December 3, a game in which he started. Thanks to first half strikes from Cengiz Under and Harvey Barnes, the Foxes claimed top spot in Group G with 13 points and will therefore be seeded for the round of 32 draw on Monday, December 14. Ndidi has taken to social media to celebrate Leicester City’s qualification as group winners.
In a two-word reaction posted on Instagram, the number 25 said: “ NEXT ROUND “.
In a premeditated substitution, Ndidi was replaced by Nampalys Mendy in the 63rd minute, four minutes before Kelechi Iheanacho subbed out.
