By Ibrahim Shuaibu Fresh Crisis rocked the Kano chapter of the All Progressive Congress (APC) on Thursday, as factional leadership under Mr Hussaini Isa Mairiga sacked Prince Abdullahi Abbas executive members loyal to Governor Abdullahi Ganduje administration. Mr Mairiga, factional leader of the APC Legacy group comprising defunct ANPP, CPC and ANC members, has been leading dissenting voices against the leadership of Mr Abdullahi Abbas, whom they accused of overstaying his welcome in the party. He told reporters on Thursday in Kano that the legacy group alleged that the Kangaroo election that saw Mr Abbas Executive into office was right from the beginning done on a very faulty foundation which was unconstitutional. “Although, Abdullahi Abbas came into being as Chairman of the party through a Kangaroo election but instead of him to try to mend fences with everybody he was busy ruling with impunity”. Mr Hussaini warned that, “because the fact remains that his executive leadership is an unconstitutional and illegal body, anything that comes under them is null and void. “In other words, what I mean is that anybody who contests the forthcoming January 2021 Local government election under the Mr Abdullahi executive leadership, he is wasting his time because his election, even if he wins, is null and void.“ “You can see that even the process that produced all the local government chairmanship candidates was so manipulative and undemocratic, where forms for the contest were not allowed to be sold to anybody but to their selective crannies.” He added, “this is the height of impunity one can see in democratic settings like this one we are running, that is why we unanimously agreed to remove him as chairman and anything that comes under him is null and void”. Mr Mairiga called on the party headquarters in Abuja to send in caretaker leadership that will see to the election of a new leadership for party in Kano, warning that failure to do so will lead to the total failure and collapse of the party in the state.
