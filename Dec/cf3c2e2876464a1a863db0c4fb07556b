PREMIER LEAGUE Roberto Firmino and Mohamed Salah both scored twice as Liverpool hit seven past Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park to go six points clear at the top of the Premier League table on Saturday. Firmino, Salah, Takumi Minamino, Sadio Mane and Jordan Henderson were all on the scoresheet as the champions overwhelmed Roy Hodgson’s side with a stunning away performance. Liverpool raced into the lead in the third minute as Mane set up Minamino, who coolly found the bottom corner.
And the Senegal international then doubled the advantage in the 35th minute after a superb turn, before Firmino tapped home to round off a brilliant counter-attack on the stroke of half-time. Captain Henderson curled in a fourth just after the restart before Firmino added his second after good work from Salah. Salah headed home a sixth with nine minutes remaining, before doubling his tally with a brilliant individual effort moments later. The Egyptian forward rounded off a brilliant team performance, as a scintillating Liverpool ensured they would be top at Christmas for the third consecutive season. Liverpool last scored seven in a top-flight away game against Derby County back in 1991.
And the side that had been hit for seven at Villa Park in Octoberwere back to their brilliant best, creating attack after attack against a sorry Palace side to win away from home in the league for the first time since September. Two days after being named FIFA men’s coach of the year, Jurgen Klopp gave a rare start to Minamino, dropping Salah to the Premier League’s first ever nine-man bench. And the Japan international soon opened the floodgates, netting his first Premier League goal exactly 12 months after it was announced he would be moving to Anfield. Mane and Firmino were both on target in a blistering first period, and the Senegal international seemed in the mood to score more, looking furious after being replaced by Salah after 57 minutes.
