By Alex Enumah As part of activities to commence the 2020/21 legal year, the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Ibrahim Muhammad, will on Monday December 14, administer oath on 72 legal practitioners recently elevated to the prestigious rank of Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN). The event, which will hold at the main courtroom of the Supreme Court, will be in strict compliance with the Covid-19 protocols, according to a statement by the Director of Information, Supreme Court, Dr Festus Akande. Akande, who recalled that the 2019/2020 legal year officially ended on Friday, September 11, 2020, said although normal court sittings started almost immediately after the formal end of the last legal year, no official ceremony has been held in accordance with the age-long tradition of the Supreme Court to formally herald the commencement of the new legal year, 2020/2021, due to the Covid-19 pandemic. “However, in strict adherence to the Covid-19 protocol, spouses and friends of the 72 newly appointed SANs will not be allowed into the vourtroom as was done in the past. Similarly, the number of dignitaries and other stakeholders will equally be limited as crowd will not be allowed inside the courtroom. “The court’s foyer will be handy to accommodate those who will not be admitted into the courtroom, as the programme will be streamed live on the giants TV screens that are placed in strategic positions within the court premises,” the director stated. He added that others can still watch the ceremony live from the comfort of their homes or offices, through social media platforms such as YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Zoom and others. “The Honourable Chief Justice of Nigeria will, as usual, give the state of the judiciary address and also present the score card of the Supreme Court in the out gone legal year, while keeping the nation abreast of the developments in the Nigerian Judiciary,” he stated.
