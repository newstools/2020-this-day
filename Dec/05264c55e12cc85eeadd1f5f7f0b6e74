FC Porto Coach Sergio Conceicao has praised Zaidu Sanusi and other players who helped the Portuguese champions to qualify for the knockout rounds of the UEFA Champions League only on their debut. Porto held Manchester City to a goalless draw Tuesday night to guarantee runners-up spot in the group with 10 points from five matches. “We achieved qualification with an impressive series of games on our part,” praised coach Conceicao. “We cannot forget to look at our XI and see Nanu, Zaidu, Manafá, Evanilson, Fábio Vieira…to see all these people with little experience in the Champions League and where they were a short time ago. “There is a great organisation to my team; our goal was achieved on full merit.” Zaidu was again impressive for Porto Tuesday and even cleared on the goalline to ensure another clean sheet for his team. Last week, he netted his first Champions League goal at Olympique Marseille.
