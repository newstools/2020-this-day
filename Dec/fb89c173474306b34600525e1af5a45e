Nigeria’s multinational telecommunications companyGlobacom, has moved to make the linking of telephone numbers with the National Identification Number (NIN) as directed by Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) easy for its subscribers. The update was contained in a statement the company’s Corporate Communication Office issued yesterday. Ranked second largest GSM operator in Nigeria, Globacom currently has 52,573,907 subscribers in Nigeria alone, according to the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC). Globacom, total telecommunications solutions provider, is currently operating in Republic of Benin, Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire with its own 9,800-kilometre submarine infrastructure that cut across Africa West Coast apart from Nigeria. In its statement yesterday, the company said subscribers could easily link their SIMs with their NIN on their phones via a short code without visiting Gloworld outlets. It said: “All our esteemed customers can now link their National Identification Number (NIN) to their mobile numbers by simply sending ‘UPDATENIN NIN FirstName and LastName’ to 109. For example, send ‘UPDATENIN 12345678903 Chidera Abdul-Ola’ to 109.” It explained that the measure was intended to make it easy and seamless for subscribers on its network to comply with the new directive by NCC and as part of its commitment to ensuring customers have uninterrupted access to its services. The telecom giant added that customers, who do not have their NIN, but have already registered with the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) can dial *346# to retrieve it. It, therefore, advised customers without a NIN to visit a NIN enrollment center to get one.
