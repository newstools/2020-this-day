The never ending, well until Jan 20, presidential denial of the election outcome is getting more extreme each day as each court case fails. The latest from a Trump interview is “This is total fraud and how – the FBI and Department of Justice, I don’t know, maybe they’re involved.” Surely, the FBI and DOJ are beyond reproach, as their basic purpose is to protect America and its way of life. They serve the President and the country, irrelevant of who it is. The 1960’s TV portal of the FBI starring Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. may have been over the top, but the good guys are still working for the FBI and the country, not against it. Shame, President Trump!
