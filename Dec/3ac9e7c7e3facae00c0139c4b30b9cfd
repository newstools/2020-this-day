Comercio Partners Limited, a leading investment bank in Lagos, was conferred with an award for the best boutique investment bank of the year over the weekend at the BusinessDay banks’ and other financial institutions (BAFI)awards, held in Lagos. The firm recently concluded a rebranding exercise in September to redefine her philosophy, essence, and identity. The respective honours came despite some stiff competition from other formidable nominees. Co-managing Partner at Comercio Partners, Tosin Osunkoya, humbled by the win remarked: “The business started a few years ago during an economic recession in the country, and despite the uncertainties my co-managing partners – Steve Osho, Nnamdi Nwizu and I forged on because we believed in the potentials that we have. Since inception, we set out to build a unique investment bank in Africa that supports our strategic agenda to develop an investment ecosystem of choice with the intent to empower minds. This win is a realisation that we are on the right path and I am elated to see those efforts get the external recognition they deserve.” “Our strategic business focus areas remain trading, investment management, financial advisory and real estate,” Osunkoya explained.
