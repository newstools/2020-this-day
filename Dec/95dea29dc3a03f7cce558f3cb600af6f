Nigerian-born winger Bright Osayi-Samuel has been nominated for the EFL Championship Goal of the Month award for November 2020.
The winger netted his second of the season as Queens Park Rangers edged a five-goal thriller against Rotherham United at the Kiyan Prince Foundation Stadium on November 24. Just before half time, Osayi-Samuel restored the Hoops one-goal lead when he swept the ball into the top corner of the net after driving into the penalty area. The 22-year-old has been nominated alongside Bournemouth’s Lewis Cook and Millwall’s Jed Wallace.
At the time of writing, Osayi-Samuel (28.4 percent) was third in the Twitter Poll, behind Cook (36.4 percent) and Wallace (35.2 percent). Despite speculation surrounding his future, the Blackpool academy product has been key for Queens Park Rangers in 2020-2021, starting 15 out of a possible 17 games in the second-tier while logging 1,262 minutes.
Last season, Osayi-Samuel won QPR’s Goal of the Season for his brilliant strike against Birmingham City and Daphne Biggs Supporters’ Young Player of the Year award.
