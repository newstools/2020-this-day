Super Falcons Captain, Asisat Oshoala, was among the scorers yesterday as Barcelona Femeni thrashed Dutch club PSV 4-1 in a round of 32 UEFA Women’s Champions League clash at the Sportcomplex De Herdgang (Eindhoven). The former Arsenal and Liverpool striker started for the Spanish powerhouse and was in action for 67 minutes before making way for Bonmati. Jenni Hermoso gave the Barcelona ladies the lead in the fourth minute after a goalkeeping error from Sari van Veenendaal which was then followed by an own goal netted by Mandy van den Berg in first half stoppage time. In the 66th minute, Oshoala handed the Blaugranes a healthy advantage when she struck from close range to make it 3-0, before Martens extended the lead with fifteen minutes left. A composed finish from Joelle Smits, following a counter-attack, reduced the deficit in the 89th minute. The return leg between Barcelona and PSV will hold at the Estadi Johan Cruyff (Sant Joan Despí) on December 16. Oshoala has scored three goals from seven appearances in the Primera División Femenina in the 2020/2021 season.
