In a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Olisa Ifeajika, yesterday in Asaba, Okowa hailed Wike for his tremendous contributions and monumental infrastructural development of the state. According to him, Wike has transformed Rivers with various life-changing projects embarked upon by his administration. He said that the governor’s strides in Rivers were visible to all, even critics, adding that Wike had performed superlatively for the state and country, and, therefore, deserved to be celebrated on his birth anniversary. “On behalf of my family, the government and people of Delta, I congratulate a gentleman of courage and great sagacity, an astute politician and a development expert, Ezenwo Nyesom Wike, on the occasion of his birth anniversary. “Since your emergence as Governor of Rivers, you have left no stone unturned in your quest to bring unprecedented infrastructural and human capital development in your state. “As a politician you have been a great voice speaking on national and contemporary issues facing our great country, and Rivers people can attest to your doggedness, commitment and steadfastness in state craftsmanship as reflected in the monumental achievements in infrastructural development of your state, which indeed earned you the sobriquet ‘Mr Projects’. “On this auspicious occasion of your birth anniversary, I join your family, friends and well-wishers to thank Almighty God for your life which has been marked by outstanding accomplishments and enduring fulfillment,” Okowa stated.
