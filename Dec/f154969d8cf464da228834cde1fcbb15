By Laleye Dipo No fewer than nine members of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) deployed in Niger State have tested positive for COVID-19, investigations have revealed. THISDAY learnt that the corps members were discovered to be positive through the tests carried out on them when they reported for the two-week orientation programme at the Paiko temporary orientation camp. It was also learnt that those affected have already been placed in isolation in one of the government facilities in the state. The development, it was gathered, stopped those concerned from passing out with others last Tuesday after the two-week orientation programme. “They are doing fine in the isolation centre,” a top official of the state Task Force on COVID-19 confided in THISDAY. No official of the state NYSC was prepared to volunteer information on the development, however, when contacted, the state Commissioner for Information, Alhaji Mohammed Sani Idris, confirmed the report, saying the relations of the affected youth corps members have been informed about the incident. Idris said as soon as they (youth corps members) come out of isolation,” they will be sent home,” but did not say if they would be allowed to continue the remaining part of their one-year assignment in Niger State. Also, the commissioner confirmed that the state Task Force on COVID 19 has begun the fumigation of the House of Assembly complex following the discovery that the Speaker, Abdullahi Bawa Wuse, and Clerk of the Assembly, Alhaji Abdullahi Kagara, tested positive for COVID-19 recently. The two Assembly members have gone into isolation, but their absence is said to be stalling the passage of the N151.6billion 2021 budget. THISDAY gathered that while Kagara is isolating at home, the Speaker, Wuse, is reported to have opted for a medical facility outside the state.
