By Omololu Ogunmade President Muhammadu Buhari at the weekend celebrated what he described as the decisive victory of Nigerian-born renowned boxer, Anthony Joshua, over Kubrat Pulev on Saturday night. The president, according to his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, said by retaining his IBF, WBA, and WBO titles, Joshua had given boxing lovers across the globe, and particularly in Nigeria, something to cheer. Adesina said Buhari recalled his meeting with the heavyweight champion in London earlier this year, describing him as a humble, well brought up young man, “who will still go places.” The statement added that Buhari wished Joshua all the best in his dream fight against Tyson Fury, assuring him of the prayers and goodwill of Nigerians towards the forthcoming battle.
