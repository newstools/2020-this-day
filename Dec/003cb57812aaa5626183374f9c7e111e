Kubrat Pulev has warned a historic fight between Tyson Fury and Anthony Joshua will not happen after he lands a shock win on Saturday. Bulgaria’s Pulev, 39, challenges Joshua for the WBA, WBO and IBF world heavyweight titles at Wembley Arena. Joshua knows a win could lead to him facing WBC champion Fury, a bout that would see all four heavyweight titles contested for the first time. “We see a lot of mistakes from Anthony,” said Pulev. “I think these mistakes, and the bad sides, stay. The most important thing is how I perform on Saturday night. When I am good, I beat him well. Right now I feel very good, strong and powerful. “This fight is not only for me. This fight isn’t just for boxing. It is for all of Bulgaria. Nobody from my country has ever been heavyweight champion of the world. “I think after this fight I’m going to fight with Tyson Fury. I don’t believe that the Joshua vs Fury fight is going to happen because I will win on Saturday night. I think the world needs a new world champion like me. I am the new world champion.” Pulev’s only defeat in 29 fights came in 2014, when he was knocked out by then world heavyweight champion Wladimir Klitschko. Saturday’s bout will take place in front of 1,000 fans with Joshua starting a 1-10 betting favourite to win. Joshua’s only defeat in 24 outings arrived in June of 2019 before he avenged the result against Andy Ruiz Jr six months later.
