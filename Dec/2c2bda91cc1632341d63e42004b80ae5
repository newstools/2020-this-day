Super Eagles duo of Wilfred Ndidi and Kelechi Iheanacho started from the bench yesterday as Leicester City defeated Sheffield United 2-1 to climb to fourth spot of the English Premier League standing. Ndidi who just returned from two months lay off due to groin injury replaced Namplays Mendy while Iheanacho came on for Ayoze Perez. Both substitutions were made in the 69th minute. The Blades looked set to secure only their second point of the season when Oli McBurnie scored his first of the campaign after Ayoze Perez had given the visitors the lead. However, the Foxes never looked like wanting to settle for a point in their pursuit of a Champions League spot. With moments of the match remaining, James Maddison fed in Jamie Vardy, who scampered clear of the home defence and slotted his shot past Aaron Ramsdale. The 33-year-old boyhood fan of Blades’ rivals Sheffield Wednesday celebrated by running to the corner flag and snapping it with his boot. Earlier, Vardy and Maddison both came close with fierce efforts that struck the Blades’ right-hand upright. Oliver Burke had United’s only other chance of note when he slipped with just Kasper Schmeichel to beat. The defeat leave Sheffield United in a perilous position at the bottom of the Premier League table.
