Technical Director of the Bobsled and Skeleton Federation of Nigeria, Seun Adigun, is excited with the official recognition of the association by the Nigeria Olympic Committee (NOC). The NOC recently granted full recognition to the Federation from the conditional approval previously accorded the Federation. “I am honored to know that the Nigerian Olympic Committee has officially recognized the Bobsled & Skeleton Federation of Nigeria (BSFN). We have truly come a long way as a federation and none of this would have been possible without the hard work and support of all the BSFN directors based in Lagos and in the United States ofAmerica. “This is proof that our impact as a federation is a sign of hope and resilience for the future of Nigerian youth”, said Adigun, who made history as Nigeria’s first ever Driver/Team Captain at the last Winter Olympics, in South Korea. In addition, she described the feat as a mission far more than sport. According to her: “It represents innovation, integrity, commitment, and community. It represents that anything is possible when you believe. “This recognition is proof that when Nigeria shows support and believes in the capabilities of the youth, we are able to use our God-given talents to uplift the country and change the world.” The Federation made a historic debut in Bobsled and Skeleton at the last Winter Olympics and is intensifying preparation for the next Winter Olympics, in Beijing.
