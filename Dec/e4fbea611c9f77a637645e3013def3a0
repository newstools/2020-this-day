High Life The Bible teaches that the life of a person is not measured by the abundance of their possessions, but by their compassion, humanity, and how much both of these factors played in their disposition to do good. On these grounds, the life of Femi Otedola cannot be measured with coffee spoons, which is the point of his latest award. The Sun Newspaper recently recognised the philanthropic work that Nigerian billionaire and world-renowned business leader, Femi Otedola is doing all around Nigeria. The award of honour recognised Otedola’s untiring dedication to those who cannot help themselves, raising the bar on what it means to be sympathetic, humanitarian, and human. While the Sun’s award is coming at the end of 2020, it is not the first, second or even third of the year. If plaques and encomiums were enough, there would be more of them tailing Otedola all year round. But the gesture is what counts: a good nod to a good man doing good deeds. Femi Otedola may not top the list of Nigeria’s wealthiest people or that of the most innovative or dogmatic. However, no Nigerian compares to him in the distribution of his resources for the public good, in raising the abandoned or impressing hope into the lives of the many and miserable. Who does not know that it was Otedola that donated $50,000 (19 million) to save the life of Super Eagles footballer and coach, Christian Chukwu? Who does not know that it was Otedola who donated two times that amount to pay the medical bills and cushion the difficulties of legendary Nollywood actor, Victor Olaotan? What about Otedola’s timely intervention in the lives of Super Eagles goalkeeper, Peter Fregene, Reggae star, Majek Fashek, another legendary Nollywood actor, Sadiq Daba, and even a stranger, UniUyo lecturer, Inih Ebong?
The good works of Femi Otedola are getting too numerous to count, and so are the awards in recognition of his humanitarian, philanthropic lifestyle.
