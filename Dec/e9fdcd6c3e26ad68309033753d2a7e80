￼ The management of National Examination Council (NECO) has set up an administrative committee to investigate allegations of examination malpractices against some of its officials, centres and candidates as exposed in an undercover report by a media house called the Signature Television. The Signature Television had released the video containing some infractions at one of the examination centres, Fabian Kings and Queens International School, Kabala West, Kaduna with Centre Number (0140721) that may lead to malpractice during the just concluded 2020 SSCE (Internal). But in a statement on Monday, Azeez Sani, Head Information and Public Relations Division at NECO said the examination body has flagged the centre contained in the video. The statement reads in part: “Based on the Council’s zero tolerance for examination malpractice, it swung swiftly into action by flagging the centre, identifying and isolating all the candidates’ scripts for scrutiny,” Sani said. “Following this action, the Council constituted an Administrative Committee to investigate the allegation in order to enable the Council take appropriate actions.” If found culpable, Sani said, ” the entire results of the candidates will be cancelled, the school will be derecognized and those examination officials involved in the act will be prosecuted in accordance with the Examination Malpractice Decree 33 of 1999″. “The Council wishes to commend the authorities of Signature Television for their interest in ensuring the sanctity of public examination and enjoins stakeholders to emulate this gesture.”
