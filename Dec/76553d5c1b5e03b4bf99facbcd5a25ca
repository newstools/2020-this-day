By Onyebuchi Ezigbo The Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Mr. Festus Keyamo, has directed Mr. Abubakar Nuhu Fikpo to take over as the Acting Director General of the National Directorate of Employment (NDE). The directive, which takes effect from Monday, December 7, 2020, authorized Fikpo to take over the administration of the agency in an acting capacity pending its ratification by the President. Keyamo said in a letter addressed to Fikpo, which was dated December 8, 2020, and titled “Appointment as Acting Director General of National Directorate of Employment,” said that “following the directive of Mr. President relieving Dr. Nasiru Mohammed Ladan Argungu as the Director General of the NDE, you are hereby directed to take over as the acting director general of the agency pending ratification by Mr. President.” A statement signed by the Deputy Director/Head (Press and Public Relations) Mr. Charles Akpan, quoted the minister of state as saying that “the directive is to ensure there is no vacuum in the administration of the agency.” He enjoined the acting director general to ensure a smooth and efficient running of the agency as well as ensuring a proper handover of all government properties in Argungu’s possession. The President had earlier directed the Minister of State for Labour and Employment to propose an acting director-general of the agency from senior directors of NDE based on competence and seniority to take over from Dr. Argungu pending the appointment of a substantive holder of that post. President Muhammadu Buhari had earlier relieved Dr. Argungu of his post as the Director General of the
NDE.
