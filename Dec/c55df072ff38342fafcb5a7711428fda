Commenting on his retirement, Emuwa said: “I have enjoyed the significant challenge of leading Union Bank over the last eight years. I am extremely proud of the management team and what we have been able to accomplish during my time as CEO. “Today, we have a strong bank that is well positioned to compete and deliver on its vision to be ‘Nigeria’s most trusted and reliable partner.’ ” With a clear strategic direction, a growing and loyal customer base and a strong brand, this is now the natural time for the next generation of leadership to take Union Bank forward and deliver further value.” Continuing, he pointed out that with over three decades of banking, his time at Union Bank has been one of the richest experiences in a long and fulfilling career with a treasure of work and life lessons to
