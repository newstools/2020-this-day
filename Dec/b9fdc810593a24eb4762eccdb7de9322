Google has introduced a new mobile-only feature that makes people more discoverable on Google Search. People Cards allow people to create their presence on Search in the form of a card, which is similar to a Google Search Knowledge Panel that includes all the details they want other people to have about them. Head of Consumer Apps, sub Saharan Africa at Google, Olumide Balogun, said “whether they’re content creators, business professionals, or just wanting to stand out from the crowd — having an online presence is important.For those without a formal website, or for people who share a name with many others, this is an easy way to create or distinguish their presence on Search.” Google’s mission has always been to organise information and make it useful and accessible, and we’re now providing a new way – for people who want to be found – to organise information about themselves, right on Search, on their mobile phones,” Balogun added. Anyone with a Google Account can create a People Card by simply searching for their name and tapping the “add me to Search” prompt. This will lead them through a simple process to add a photo, description, links to social profiles and other information that they’d like others to know about them. For the initial card creation, a unique phone number is required. One profile card is allowed per Google account and phone number. Additionally, people can report abusive content and impersonation claims through a feedback link directly from the product. “In the last few years, we have been working with people across the region to better understand how Africans see Search and how we can make it more relevant and work better for the people on the continent,” Balogun further said.
