By Chiemelie Ezeobi The annual Chief of Army Staff’s (COAS) conference was Thursday canceled over the death of a Major General (namewithheld) who died from COVID-19 complications. Although the army authorities did not divulge the identity of the general or his present state, it did however admit that the general tested positive for COVID-19. THISDAY findings however, showed that after the general fell sick last Monday, he was taken to the military hospital for treatment. He took a turn for the worse and allegedly died due to complications arising from the COVID-19 infection. In a statement by acting Director Army Public Relations, Brigadier General Sagir Musa, he said the cancellation was due to the resurgence of COVID-19 Pandemic in the Federal Capital Territory Abuja, in what appears to be a second wave of infection cycle. He said unfortunately, “an officer participating in the ongoing Chief of Army Staff’s Annual Conference 2020 here in Abuja tested positive to COVID 19,” hence the cancellation of the remaining activities of the conference. He said: “All the participants have been mandated to immediately proceed on self isolation in line with the federal government’s protocol for COVID 19 and to prevent any further spread of the disease. “All inconveniences hereby regretted please. Thanks for your usual understanding and cooperation.”
