By Michael Olugbode The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Commission has called for the prosecution of the killers of rice farmers in Borno State. A statement issued by the ECOWAS Commission last Monday also called for regional, continental and international solidarity to fight against terrorism. According to the statement, “The ECOWAS Commission has learnt with deep sadness the terrorist attacks in North-eastern Nigeria on November 28, 2020, in the village of Kwashabe and other rural communities in the Jere Local Government Area near Maiduguri, the Borno State capital. “During the terrorist attacks, more than 100 civilians were ruthlessly killed and many others are believed to have been kidnapped. “ECOWAS is hurt by these senseless killings, and the ECOWAS Commission condemns vigorously this terrorist attack. ECOWAS Commission, therefore, calls for the perpetrators of this heinous crime to be brought to justice.” The statement added that: “The ECOWAS Commission restates its appeals for regional, continental and international solidarity with the ECOWAS member states at the forefront of the fight against terrorism and also with the ECOWAS Commission in the implementation of the ‘2020-2024 Priority Action Plan on the Eradication of Terrorism in ECOWAS’.”
