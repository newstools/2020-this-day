By Omololu Ogunmade President Muhammadu Buhari Tuesday met with 36 state governors of the federation, in the State House behind closed doors. Although details of the meeting were sketchy as at press time, it was learnt that the agenda for the meeting was not unconnected with escalating security challenges plaguing the country. The governors had in their meeting in Abuja last week, following the massacre of over 43 rice farmers in Zabarmari, Borno State, resolved to meet Buhari on the need to decisively address security challenges bedeviling the country. Chairman of the Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF) and Governor of Ekiti State, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, had in a communique issued after the meeting, said the governors also resolved to support necessary reforms that will culminate in the emergence of an effective police force that will serve all citizens. The communique had stated: “As an immediate to medium-term measure, members agreed to pay close attention to the conduct of police officers across the country in order to get them and other internal security operatives fully back to work as they have not been functioning to full capacity since the EndSARS protests with the attendant security exposure to the safety of lives and properties of the ordinary citizens.”
