By Rebecca Ejifoma Emergency responders Sunday curtailed the inferno that engulfed Ketu Plank Market on Demurin Street in Ketu area of Lagos. The fire outbreak was said to have erupted from one part of the market then spread to other areas. According to the responders, while the cause of the fire is yet to be unravelled, it is evident that there is extensive damage with valuable goods destroyed by the fire. The DG/CEO, Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA), Dr Olufemi Oke-Osanyintolu, noted that no life was lost in the inferno. He said: “The inferno has been brought under control and dampened down by LASEMA Response Team and the Lagos State Fire Service.” This is coming as the LASEMA Response Unit has recovered a trailer conveying a 40ft container that ran over a culvert at Mile 2 inward Kirikiri earlier Sunday. According to the DG, investigations by the LRT has revealed that the accident is a result of brake failure of the trailer. He said that no life was lost, and none was injured in the incident where the LRT, LASTMA and men of the Nigerian police were responders. “The affected trailer has been evacuated off the road to a layby with aid of the agency’s heavy duty equipment,” he added. The LASEMA boss, therefore, urged the public to be cautious at all times, especially when dealing with heavy duty equipment or machinery.
