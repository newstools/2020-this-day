Going into today’s match in the Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium, where Real are currently playing their home games instead of the Santiago Bernabéu, Diego Simeone’s Atlético are currently topping the table. Together, the trio have scored 11 of the 21 goals the club has scored in the league this season, with Félix and Suarez both having scored five. But even if Atlético Madrid are clearly the in-form in Spain at the moment, history is on the side of their rivals. Of the 158 games played, Real Madrid have won 85, while Atlético have won 39 matches.
