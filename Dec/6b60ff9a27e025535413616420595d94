James Emejo in Abuja The Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) yesterday said it had commenced a process to liquidate 42 microfinance banks (MFBs) following the recent revocation of their licences by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). Accordingly, the corporation stated that it would today begin to verify the claims of stakeholders of the affected institutions. The NDIC, in a public notice said the verification exercise would hold at the branches of the MFB and would involve meeting with the depositors, creditors, and shareholders of the banks to ascertain their relationships as well as their deposits in preparatory to their liquidation. The CBN had in 2018 revoked the operating licences of about 153 MFBs and six Primary Mortgage Banks (PMBs). Meanwhile, NDIC Executive Director (Corporate Services), Hon. Omolola Abiola-Edewor, has identified judgments against the corporation for liabilities of failed banks under liquidation as another challenge confronting the deposit insurer. Speaking at the opening ceremony of the 2020 sensitisation seminar for judges of the Federal High Court in Abuja with the theme: ‘The Challenges to Deposit Insurance Law and Practice in Nigeria’, Edewor said that the effective resolution of legal issues affecting the administration of the deposit insurance system was critical to the enhancement of safety and soundness of the banking system. She also blamed the limited understanding and the widespread misconception of the Deposit Insurance System (DIS) in the country as largely responsible for the pool of unclaimed deposits following bank closures.
