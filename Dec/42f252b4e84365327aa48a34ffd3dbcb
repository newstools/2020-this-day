Omololu Ogunmade in Abuja President Muhammadu Buhari Saturday condoled with the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) over the loss of 20 doctors to COVID-19 in one week. The president who acknowledged the sacrifices of the late doctors, said no sacrifice could be too much for the well-being of health workers, submitting that doctors’ welfare is a priority for his government. Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, in a statement, said the president had sent his condolence message to the NMA over the death of the doctors who died in active service. Shehu quoted the president as saying, “The death of our front line health workers in the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic is particularly sad because these professionals risk their own lives in order to save others. “Our health workers are making maximum sacrifices for the country in line with their humanitarian calling, and this administration will leave no stone unturned in order to ensure their needs are met.”
“Our health workers are operating under severe limitations, but they are undeterred in discharging their duties in saving lives.
“Let me say without any fear of contradiction that no reward is too much for the sacrifices of our health workers in the country, and this administration will give their welfare the priority it deserves.” The statement added that the president said he was saddened by the demise of the Galadiman Lokoja, Chief Godwin Ajakpo, and the Chairman of Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF), Air Commodore Idongesit Nkanga (rtd.), a former military governor.
