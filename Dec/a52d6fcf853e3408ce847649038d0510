Funmi Ogundare Governor Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia State has suspended his Chief of Staff (CoS), Chief Anthony Agbazuere, indefinitely with immediate effect. This was following a viral video of Agbazure recklessly spraying new naira notes on the popular controversial preacher, Chukwuemeka Odumeje at his office. A video went viral on Sunday morning, including widespread calls for the governor to sanction the top aide.
