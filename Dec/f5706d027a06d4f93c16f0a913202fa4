By Victor Ogunje The Governor of Ekiti State, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, has approved the appointment of  Mr. Samuel Ibidunmoye as the state Surveyor-General . In the same vein, Fayemi appointed Mr. Victor Adeuya, as the Auditor-General of the state. The new surveyor General, who has been in the position in acting capacity, was at a time the Executive Secretary of the state Boundary Commission. In a statement in Ado Ekiti yesterday by the Chief Press Secretary, Yinka Oyebode, Fayemi said the two appointments are with immediate effect. Fayemi said the appointments had earlier been confirmed by the state House of Assembly. Ibidunmoye, a surveyor by profession,  applauded Fayemi for seening him worthy of being appointed into such a sensitive position in the state civil service. He promised to abide by all the rules guiding his new position and ensure that all actions are taken without compromising the civil service rules. “I know the ethics of civil service and what should be my priority as an officer of the state. I promise to abide by all rules and prevent my personal wish to override the interest of the state on issues relating to land matters and other allied issues,” he said.
