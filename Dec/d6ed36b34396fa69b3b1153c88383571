* Election now to hold in Imo Amby Uneze in Owerri Imo State consensus candidate for the post of president general of Ohanaeze Ndigbo in the coming January election, Professor George Obiozor, was yesterday carried out unconscious from the venue of the Imeobi meeting of the organisation. Midway an expanded meeting of the Imeobi (the highest organ of Ohanaeze), Obiozor was said to be exhibiting unusual behaviour. He was escorted out of the hall where the meeting was taking place at the Nike Lake Resort, Enugu. It was gathered that as he was being escorted out, he suddenly slumped and passed out. He was driven away unconscious to an unknown destination in an unmarked SUV. Obiozorâ€™s dilemma happened in presence of Governor Hope Uzodimma of Imo state, Ministers Chris Ngige and Ogbonnaya Onu, former Senate President, Anyim Pius Anyim, Senator Osita Izunaso, Chief Chekwas Okorie and the deputy governor of Ebonyi State as well as others. The Imeobi meeting, held for the second time within one month was in regards to the forthcoming elections of the apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation. Said to be the most peaceful since the inception of the organisation, objections were raised to the constitution of the 40 member election committee. Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, opposed the chairmanship of the election committee which is occupied by Ben Obi from Anambra State. That was, however, resolved as Obi voluntary stepped down for peace to reign paving the way for a former president general of the organisation, Gary Enwo Igariwey from Ebonyi state who was unanimously adopted. A clergy, Bishop Gordy Okafor was nominated as deputy chairman and was also unanimously adopted. It was also resolved that the January election will take place in Owerri, Imo state. And henceforth elections shall be held in the state whose turn it is to produce the president general.
