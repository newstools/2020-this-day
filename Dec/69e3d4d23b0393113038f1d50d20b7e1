Anthony Joshua pointed in Kubrat Pulev’s face during a furious exchange of words at the weigh-in for their world heavyweight title fight. Britain’s WBA, IBF and WBO champion reacted to taunts from Pulev, even before he tipped the scales at 17st 2lbs for today’s fight at The SSE Arena in Wembley. Security stepped between Joshua and the Bulgarian challenger, who had weighed in at 17st 1lbs, but both fighters then became embroiled in a heated face-off before they were eventually separated on the stage. Joshua reacted to Sky Sports: “I would have clapped him on his jaw, just then.
“But I have to wait till tomorrow. “I know what he is like. I’ve studied him. He thinks he’s a warrior.
“I said to him: ‘Don’t let the guys that you’ve fought gas you up, you’re against a real one now’. “When people come in the ring with me, they are confident. After a few rounds their soul is destroyed. Once I see that, I can take him out.
“We are big boys. We punch heavy. First man to land will be the last man standing.”
