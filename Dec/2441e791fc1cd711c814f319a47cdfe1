By Sylvester Idowu The Vice-Chancellor of the Federal University of Petroleum Resources, (FUPRE), Effurun, Delta State, Prof. Akpofure Rim-Rukeh, has lauded the federal government’s policy on commercialisation of gas, stating that the Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano Gas Pipeline project will drastically reduce gas flaring in Nigeria. Speaking at the annual International Environmental Management Stakeholders’ Conference, organised by the Chartered Institute of Environmental and Public Health Management of Nigeria at the institution, Prof. Rim-Rukeh stated that the discovery of oil in Oloibiri in 1958 was a welcome development, but regretted that the interest was only on crude oil, while gas was left to flare without considering environmental pollution. He however commended the present federal administration on efforts at ensuring that the environment is safe for the citizens, especially those who reside in such areas of exploration with the initiative of the Ajaokuta-Kaduana-Kano Gas Pipeline project. He maintained that the air the people breathe in, the food they eat and the water they drink are sacrosanct to good health and commended the organisers, especially for choosing notable topics on how to manage the environment with lectures delivered by Prof. S.A Olagoke and Prof. Olagoke, among other guest speakers. The highpoint of the ceremony was the induction of the vice-chancellor into the institute and investiture of executive committee members of the Delta State chapter of the institute.
