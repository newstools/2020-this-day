By Vanessa Obioha After two days of fierce competition on the grandest runway in Africa, Arise Fashion Week, Kenneth Ize has emerged winner of the 30 Under 30 competition. The emotional winner found himself gasping for words as Naomi Campbell announced him as winner of the event that kicked off on Friday, December 10. Ize was rewarded with a $100,000 cash prize while runners-up Ré Lagos and South African Mmuso Maxwell receive $75,000 and $50,000 respectively. The three winners emerged from a pool of eight designers which included Lagos Space Programme, Ziva Lagos, TJWho, Onalaja and Ajabeng. Known for his use of hand-woven textiles and vibrant colours, Ize’s collection boasts colorful striped jackets, tailored suits worn over tights as well as a knitted hat. The finale brought to a close the 2020 Arise Fashion Week which defied the odds of the pandemic and held virtually for the first time. The theme of this year’s event was ’30 Under 30: The New Stars’ where 30 designers were selected to participate in the competition. It also featured Campbell and Alton Mason modelling for designers like Mmuso Maxwell, Bloke, Tzar Studios, Lagos Space Programme and Colr.
