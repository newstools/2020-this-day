By George Okoh A casual staff of Gwer East Local Government Area (GELGA), identified as Mr. Aondona Yaga, has set himself ablaze. According to his grandmother, who was seen around his abandoned corpse yesterday morning, life became very miserable for Yaga who has not been paid his allowances as a casual staff for close to three years. He decided to take away his life when he could not find money to treat his illness. The Information Officer of GELGA, Mr. Chris Avi, confirmed the news of Yagaâ€™s death and status as a staff of the local government without further details. The Public Relations Officer of the Benue Police Command, CSP Sewuese Anene, also confirmed the incident but said the police is still investigating.
