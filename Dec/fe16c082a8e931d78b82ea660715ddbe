By Segun Awofadeji The ruling People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in Bauchi state has reacted to the outcome of last Saturday’s bye-election into the State House of Assembly in Dass local government where the APC candidate won the election. State PDP Publicity Secretary, Alhaji Yayanuwa Zainabari, in an interview with journalists Tuesday in Bauchi, opined that the former speaker of the House of Representatives Yakubu Dogara who represents the constituency in the National Assembly was not instrumental to the APC victory in the election as being insinuated. According to him, Dogara never won elections in the local government since his venture into politics, claiming that the former speaker used to win in only Bogoro and Tafawa Balewa local governments. Zainabari revealed that even in the last 2019 poll, Dogara’s opponent defeated the former speaker in Dass local government. “Even though we lost this election in Dass local government which is one of the local government areas Dogara represents, he cannot claim credit. “For instance, in the 2019 election, Dogara did not win in Dass. Therefore, credit goes to the APC not Dogara”, he alleged. The PDP spokesperson noted that the party had understood its lapses that led to its defeat in the bye-election assuring that they would capture all the seats being occupied by the APC in the state assembly come 2023. He asserted that governor Bala Mohammed deserved commendation for allowing the electoral body to conduct free and fair election without interference. The party also noted that the PDP led government had provided a higher institution in the local government which hitherto was the only emirate in the state without a tertiary institution. He called on the residents of the area to support the government and party in the next election.
