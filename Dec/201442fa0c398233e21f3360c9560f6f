He is on the shy side of society, but you cannot take away his dexterity when it comes to achieving the purpose of what he has set up to become in life. Adeleye Fabusoro, Chief Executive Officer, Rare Edge, believes that not all that glitters is gold. Hence, he does not believe in flashy things. Fabusoro, who holds a Master’s degree in Business Administration from the University of Ibadan, rather believes that “All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.” An executive producer of repute, he stated that the second series of the award-winning soap opera, BÒRÒKÌNÍ, a 120- episode Telenovela, will be a thriller. Borokini’s story exposes the latent dirt of the elite class and lets people know that the rich also cry and that not all that glitters is gold. He further stated that what Rare Edge Media has done is to examine the life of the seemingly untouchable and show the chink in their impenetrable armour. “So Borokini is inspired by the society we live in and how it affects the people; how the story can encourage and influence people in the society. And for a series that took over a year to produce, from production to broadcast, there is no gainsaying that it’s worth the wait.”
