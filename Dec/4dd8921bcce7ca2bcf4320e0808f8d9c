By Chuks Okocha In compliance with the Court of Appeal directives, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has issued a Certificate of Return to Hon. Jarigbe Agom Jarigbe as the winner and duly elected candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the last Cross River North Senatorial by-election. The Court of Appeal had directed INEC to issue Jarigbe the certificate of return as the duly and the substantive candidate of the PDP which won the election. The appellate court had affirmed the judgment of an FCT High Court which had earlier declared Hon. Jarigbe as duly elected PDP candidate for the December 5 Cross River North Senatorial seat. The certificate of return was handed over to Jarigbe by an INEC National Commissioner, Mr. Festus Okoye at a brief ceremony in Abuja. Before the appellate court ruling, INEC had earlier issued a certificate of return to Dr Stephen Odey.
