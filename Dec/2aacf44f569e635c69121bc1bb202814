The Christian Book of Common Prayer states that although man has a short time to live on the earth, this life is full of misery and sudden changes. None of these characteristics were ever used for Albert Okumagba until his passing away at the age of 56. The relatives of stock trading genius and expert of financial matters, Albert Egbaroghene Okumagba, have released the burial plans for his interment. According to the plans, the late Okumagba will be laid to rest in January 2021. The soul of the departed will be sent off in line with Christian tradition, from both Lagos and Warri. The released fliers of Okumagba’s burial arrangements show that the internment process will take place on the 11, 12, 15, and 17 of January 2021. On Monday the 11, 6 pm, there will be a requiem mass at the Church of Assumption, Falomo, Ikoyi. On the 12th, Pastor Ituah Ighodalo will host a ‘Night of Tributes’ at the Trinity House Church, Victoria Island, starting at 5 pm. These are the events to be held in Lagos. On the 15, the Warri branch of the Church of Assumption (at Idama) will hold the funeral mass for Albert Okumagba (at 10 am), and then the actual burial will immediately follow. Thus, Okumagba remains will be laid on the earth at Ighogbadu Road, Okumagba Layout, Warri. Afterward, there will be a reception Service at KFT, opposite the College of Education back gate. On the 17th, a thanksgiving mass will be held in honour of Alfred Okumagba, from 10 am, at the Church of Assumption, Idama, and the late CEO/MD of BGL PLC will be a painful memory for his relatives, friends, and associates. Okumagba will be remembered for many things, chief among them, his mind for all things finance. Until his untimely departure, he was a figure at the same level with bank directors and conglomerate heads. Anyway, until Okumagba is forgotten by relatives, friends, associates, the stock market, and every other thing related to him, death has not won.
