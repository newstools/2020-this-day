By John Shiklam A meeting of the Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG) to discuss the security challenges in the north was disrupted by armed thugs, who invaded the Arewa House, venue of the event on Monday. The hoodlums were said to have attacked guests at the summit, smashed some vehicles, shattered windows and overturned chairs, with some people sustaining injuries. Confirming the attack in a statement, the spokesman of the CNG, Abdul-Azeez Suleiman, said armed thugs numbering hundreds unleashed terror on guests who attended a summit organised by his group at the Arewa House. He said the summit was aimed at “discussing ways to achieve synergy between communities and government security and design a uniform approach to the current security situation in the ñorth”. According to him, participants at the meeting included retired military and police officers, religious leaders, traditional rulers and women, youth and trade associations. “Just as the meeting was kicking off, sponsored armed thugs stormed the auditorium after subduing the civil guards at the gate. “They overturned tables, shattered glasses, attacked the guests and officials, wounding several people and smashing vehicles parked in the premises,” the statement said. According to him, “It is disturbing that a battalion of armed thugs can stroll free across the streets of central Kaduna wielding dangerous weapons without the intervention of the security.” He said security personnel only arrived hours after the thugs had left. “It is quite obvious now that some powerful forces are benefiting from the current security situation and would do everything for it to continue. “We are now all the more committed to ensuring the safety and security of the north and its people,” the statement said.
