Nigeria’s leading digital bank, V Bank has extended its brand engagement with Mavin Records CEO and digital influencer, Don Jazzy. At a recent event, the bank executives presented a V-branded hoodie to the renowned producer as a symbol of the one-year contract with the bank. “Tonight we celebrate the birth and heart of a great man,” said the Senior Product Manager of V bank, Ebere Ahaotu. “We have worked with Mavin Records since we launched in March and they have shown nothing short of professionalism in our dealings. When you build a product that truly solves problems, and then find a genuinely lovable individual to complement it, the effect of that combination is amazing.” Held in Lagos, the ceremony which coincided with the influencer’s 38th birthday was witnessed by select fans who are also clients of the bank, as well as the ambassador’s father. “I’m humbled to have celebrated this evening with the great minds at V Bank. I don’t take for granted the feeling of belonging to something so phenomenal in the wake of digital banking in Nigeria. It means so much to me spending a new phase of my life with a partner that effortlessly shares my vision to financially empower digital natives,” said Don Jazzy.
