Dapo Ojora, a socialite and one of the sons of board room guru, Otunba Adekunle Ojora and Erelu Ojuolape Ojora is dead. Dapo, reportedly shot himself in the head yesterday evening according to sources although his family is yet to confirm the report. Having mysteriously escaped death sometime back via a ghastly power bike accident, which forced him to beat a retreat from the public space, it therefore comes as a shock that the polo buff would take his own life in such a gruesome manner.
