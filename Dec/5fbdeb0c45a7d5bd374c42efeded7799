Bennett Oghifo Some people who claimed to be victims of the alleged shooting by soldiers at the Lekki Toll Gate during a generally peaceful demonstration, were at the venue of the Lagos State Judicial Inquiry yesterday. The people who rode in a white bus, were led by a young lady, accompanied by another set of persons with a banner on which they inscribed ‘New Nigeria Network.’ According to the lady, “We have people with amputated legs; we have people with brain surgery in this van; we have dozens of them that are yet to be discharged. This is from Lekki tollgate massacre 2020. We want justice. We don’t want to be silenced; we don’t want to be marginalised even in our own country.”
