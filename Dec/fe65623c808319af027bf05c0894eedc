US President Donald Trump has said that he will not be taking the COVID-19 vaccine any time soon. This he said it was as a result of a directive he gave which will delay the administration of the vaccine on those in the White House. Taking to Twitter, Trump said he was “not scheduled to take the vaccine, but look forward to doing so at the appropriate time.” “People working in the White House should receive the vaccine somewhat later in the programme, unless specifically necessary. “I have asked that this adjustment be made,” he wrote.
