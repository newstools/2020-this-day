The Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) last week lifted the suspension placed on trading of the shares of Niger Insurance Plc. The insurance firm was suspended along with other firms in September for failing to file accounts. However, the exchange lifted the suspension, saying the company has now filed its outstanding financial statements. According to the exchange, the accounts complied with all applicable rules.
