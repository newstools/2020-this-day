The Vice Presidential Candidate of the Peopleâ€™s Democratic Party, PDP, in 2019 elections, Mr. Peter Obi, has encouraged health workers nationwide to see their profession as a very noble one, through which they can render selfless service to humanity. Speaking to health workers at Annunciation Specialist Hospital, Enugu on Wednesday, November 18, 2020, Obi appreciated them for the brave fight they had so far put against the COVID-19 pandemic. Obi reminded them that their profession is a big platform for them to serve God and man, who alone can reward man for every good deed. While presenting a cheque of N1,000,000 to the hospital management to help them step up their health service delivery and to offset the bills of some indigent persons at the hospital, Obi urged them to continue to pray for the nation that its leaders may use national resources prudently for common good. Appreciating Obi for his benevolence, the Assistant Manager of Annunciation Specialist Hospital, Rev. Sr Uchenna Nwafor, recalled how he donated COVID-19 relief materials to the Hospital at the peak of the pandemic. He thanked Obi for his generosity and prayed God to continue to bless him.
