Represented by Assistant Director, Corporate Communications of the CBN, Sam Okogbue, the apex bank governor advised Nigerians “to return to production of what they consume. Nigerians should go back to moderation of their taste and consumption of foreign food. “If we do so, it will help the government to stabilise the economy,” he emphasized.
