Also briefing, the Minister of State for Budget and National Planning, Mr. Clement Agba, said the council approved a memorandum for ratification of the Nigerian Road Safety Strategy II. According to him, this initiative is an update on the maiden Nigerian Road Safety Strategy I which was in force from 2014-2018. Giving an insight into NRSS I and II, Agba said while the former was conceived to reduce road crashes by 35 percent, the latter was evolved to further reduce crashes by 50 percent, among other useful plans. Agba said: “There are four basic differences between NRSS I and NRSS II. One is the goal setting. For NRSS I, the reduction in road traffic crashes was to be by 35 percent by end of the year 2018. This has been pushed further and reduced to 50 percent by the year 2030. “In NRSS I, there was just one oversight advisory council which was at federal level, the National Road Safety Advisory Council. NRSS II has now set up state roads safety advisory councils in addition to the National Road Safety Advisory Council. “Apart from the strategic activities defined in the pillars in NRSS I, NRSS II now includes global framework plan of action, and then, the documents that have been rephrased have now increased from four to about nine. “The pillars upon which this strategy is based are road safety management, safer roads and mobility, safer road users which is very paramount, more important than the road conditions, safer vehicles and then the post crash care.”
