By Olawale Ajimotokan The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, has expressed huge shock and sadness at the death of the Publisher of Leadership Newspapers, Mr. Sam
Nda-Isaiah.
In a statement issued in Abuja on Saturday, Mohammed described Nda-Isaiah’s death as a great loss, not just to his family and the media industry but to the nation at large.
”True to the motto of his newspaper, ‘For God and Country’, Nda-Isaiah lived for his family, as well as for God and country. He had an unwavering belief in Nigeria and its ability to overcome its
challenges and become a foremost member of the comity of nations. For him, it was not just a belief, it was a mantra.
”He demonstrated his abiding faith in the country not just in words but in deed. Where many saw challenges, he saw opportunity. Where many
peddled fear, he preached hope. When many chose to fire darts, he opted to soothe nerves. He was indeed a great Nigeria and a true friend and brother,” he said.
He said Nda-Isaiah’s can-do spirit saw him record success after success, either as a publisher, politician or an entrepreneur.
”We, as a people, are poorer without this visionary of a man. We can only take solace in the great legacy he left behind,” he said.
He prayed that God will take Nda-Isaiah to his bosom and give strength and comfort to his family and friends in this dark moment.
