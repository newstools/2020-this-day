Ambong Energy Services Limited and the Petroleum Training Institute (PTI), Efurun, Delta State have signed a historic pact to jointly build capacity for the oil and gas industry in Nigeria and across Africa. The agreement which was signed at the PTI on Tuesday, was expected to position the two organisations to train youths on specialised skills for the oil and gas industry. According to a statement, this would reduce the influx of expatriates, reduce capital flights associated with overseas training and position Nigeria to become a global exporter of specialized labour. The Managing Director, Ambong, Engr. John Nwosu, was quoted to have stated that the country cannot create all the jobs needed by Nigerians, “hence it has become imperative for us to impart our people with the skills that are sort after around world.” He added: “This will enable them to apply for international jobs and offer their services to international oil companies. The Principal of PTI while responding said he is happy that a day like has finally come.” He stressed that the partnership will check youth restiveness and solve the youth unemployment challenge in Nigeria.
