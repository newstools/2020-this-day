By Peter Uzoho The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has announced the appointment of Ms. Murjanatu Ibrahim Gamawa as the Implementation Programme Manager for the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). The corporation said the appointment was in line with its resolve to deepen compliance with the transparency standards dictated by the EITI as a supporting company and to help drive speedy attainment of the EITI requirements across its operations. NNPC in a statement signed by its Group General Manager, Group Public Affairs Division, Dr. Kennie Obateru, stated that Gamawa’s appointment which would take effect from January 2021, was a practical step towards entrenching the culture of transparency in the corporation. Gamawa, a petroleum geologist, was until her appointment, the EITI Country Manager in charge of coordinating implementation of EITI standards across Anglophone Africa. She also worked at the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) as a petroleum analyst and team lead of the Oil and Gas Team. Gamawa’s wealth of experience across the oil and gas industry and in EITI mandate implementation is expected to boost the corporation’s compliance strategy and roadmap.
