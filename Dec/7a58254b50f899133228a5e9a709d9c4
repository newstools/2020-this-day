By Seriki Adinoyi The Northern Governors Forum (NGF) has condemned Saturday’s attack by bandits on Government Science Secondary School, Kankara in Katsina State, describing the development as “unfortunate, regrettable and intolerable”. The Chairman of the Forum and Governor of Plateau State, Simon Lalong, in a statement signed by his Director of Press, Dr. Simon Macham, expressed solidarity with the Governor of Katsina State, Aminu Bello Masari, the government and people of the state, adding that the governors stand with the authorities as they do everything possible to respond to the situation and ensure that no student gets missing or harmed. The Forum said it remained solidly behind the security agencies that have responded appropriately and have been in pursuit of the bandits to ensure that normalcy is restored and the criminals are apprehended. He added that the governors appreciate the directive by President Muhammadu Buhari to the security forces to deploy every available resource needed to deal with the situation. Lalong said the prayers of the Forum are with the families of the students, the school authorities and the injured, even as he called on the citizens to volunteer useful information to the security agencies and relevant government bodies that will assist in the quick resolution of the sad incident.
