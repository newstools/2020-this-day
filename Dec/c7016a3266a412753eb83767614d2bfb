By David-Chyddy Eleke The Assistant Inspector-General of Police (AIG) in charge of Zone 13, Ukpo, Anambra State, Danmallam Mohammed, has said that the support of the media to security agencies can help combat crime in Nigeria. Danmallam stated this when the leadership of the Correspondents’ Chapel, Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Anambra State council paid him a courtesy visit in his office. He said the media is very critical in solving the problem of insecurity in the country, while also soliciting the cooperation of media practitioners in Anambra State towards the success of police operations in providing security of lives and property. He said: “The society will benefit more from police operations if the media and police work in synergy. “I call on the members of the chapel to be objective in their reportage. Journalists should not only criticize, but should also proffer solutions that could help the police in discharging their duties more effectively.” Earlier, the Chairman of the chapel, Mr. Emma Ndukuba, said the visit was to formally welcome the AIG to the state, and to invite him to their forthcoming symposium, tagged: “Anambra 2021: Setting Agenda for a Credible leadership.” Ndukuba explained that the symposium was in preparation for the coming November governorship election in the state. He assured the AIG that members of the chapel were ready to partner with the police to solve insecurity, and also committed to contributing their quota to ensuring proper reportage of the poll.
