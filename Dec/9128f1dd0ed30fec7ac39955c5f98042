The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has reiterated calls for behavioural changes and need for caution among the public, as the state ramps up efforts to halt the spread of coronavirus in the wake of the second wave of the pandemic. The governor, in a virtual meeting with journalists in Edo State, noted that the state’s campaign against the coronavirus pandemic is peculiar because it was also battling with Lassa fever, as this was also its peak period in the state. According to him, “The last time we had to deal with the pandemic, we had enough time to respond and develop an epidemiological curve that showed how the disease behaves. This time around, we have to be cautious. COVID-19 is hitting us quickly. “The real issue is changing the attitude and behaviour of our people. It is a festive season and they have to take personal precaution. The state government would take adequate measures to protect the people, but they are also to take personal responsibility.” Noting that the state would ensure proper management of new cases of the disease, he said, “For Edo State, we are fighting Lassa Fever this season. In Irrua, the bed spaces have been taken already and we may not even have enough room for COVID-19 cases.” The governor charged media organisations in the state to step up engagement on the severity of the second wave of COVID-19, urging the need to emphasize the importance of residents taking personal responsibility in protecting themselves and halting the spread of the virus. Former State Chairman of Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Mr. Ralph Okhiria, thanked the governor for being proactive, noting that the journalists would do well to enjoin the public to take personal responsibility in halting the spread of COVID-19. Media houses with representatives present at the meeting include Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria (FRCN), KUFM, SpeedFM, Raypower, Rhythm FM, PUNCH Newspaper, Tribune Newspaper and the Nigerian Observer, among others.
