In a colourful event at the newly registered American Polytechnic of Nigeria (APN), gospel music sensation, Evangelist Tope Alabi thrilled eminent personalities at the Christmas Carol Service organised by the institution. Known for her powerful vocals and soul-lifting songs Alabi led other top gospel artistes to sing different carols, eliciting a Christmas cheer that is badly needed in a pandemic-driven era. Her performance added colour and vibrance to the event that also doubled as a grand opening of the institution. In his opening remarks, the founder Dare Akande in the company of his wife, Nay’marie, gave a brief history about the institution and talked about how he identified the vast knowledge gap as one of the major problems facing the continent of Africa, which, according to him, made African youths so vulnerable. “Given the recent industrial revolution, I agree with the general notion that the future is now and the simplest way to name a future is to make yourself. There is a little margin of error in the life of many Nigerian and African children who are left behind in every aspect of the economy’s progress.” He added that this informed the urgency about equipping Nigeria young adults with current knowledge to solve social-economic problems in this era of fast-paced technological advancement. Dignitaries who graced the event included the Oyo State Deputy Governor, Rauf Olaniyan; the Ajero of Ijero-Ekiti, Oba Joseph Adebayo Adewole; the Aseyin of Iseyin, Oba Abd-Ganiy Adekunle Salau; and popular actress Rose Odika.
