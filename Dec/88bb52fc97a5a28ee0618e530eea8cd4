The President has signed another Executive Order (Executive Order 13967 of December 18, 2020, Promoting Beautiful Federal Civic Architecture) which basically says that all new Federal buildings must be beautiful which seems to suggest that they will be built in a Greek or Roman style and there will be a lot of columns. This is probably, but might not be, the most stupid executive order ever signed. Yes, Roman building as pretty but the best known, the Coliseum is starting to lose its glamour and a lot of bricks. A look at recent Executive order shows that there are a few challenges for the most odd ones including the use of trustworthy A.I. (Executive Order 13960 of December 3, 2020, Promoting the Use of Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in the Federal Government). This could be a goer as there seems to be little natural intelligence and not everyone there is trusted by the President. One that seems a bit silly is the concern with TikTok (Executive Order 13942 of August 6, 2020, addressing the Threat Posed by TikTok) where the main danger seems to be the number of videos that satirize President Trump. This fad will soon disappear, not TikTok but satirizing President Trump. We all look forward to Jan 20 and the New President and less strange proclamations. Merry Xmas. Dennis Fitzgerald,
