By Adedayo Akinwale and Udora Orizu President Muhammadu Buhari will on Thursday address a joint session of the National Assembly on efforts being made by his administration to address the security challenges currently bedevilling the country. This was disclosed by the President’s Personal Assistant on Social Media, Lauretta Onochie, via a message she posted on her Twitter handle, @Laurestar, on Monday. The message read, ”President @MBuhari will address a joint session of the National Assembly (@nassnigeria) on Thursday, December 10, 2020.” Recall that the House of Representatives had last week Tuesday resolved to invite the President to appear before the House and explain the security situation in the country. The resolution followed the adoption of a motion of urgent national importance moved by the Borno State caucus on the killing of over 43 rice farmers in the state. The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, had last Wednesday said the President had agreed to visit the parliament and address Nigerians.
