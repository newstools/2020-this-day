By James Sowole Ondo State Governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, has said that the state would employ more persons into the Amotekun Corps and give them necessary equipment needed for successful operations in the fight against crimes and criminality. Governor Akeredolu who spoke yesterday while receiving members of the Ifon Progressive Union led by its President, Chief Femi Awani, said the worsening security situation across the country was worrisome. The Ondo governor said arms and ammunition got into the wrong hands in the aftermath of the #ENDSARS protest. He added that the good virtues of Oba Israel Adeusi, the Olufon of Ifon, who was killed by suspected kidnappers, would not be forgotten. Akeredolu described the late Oba Adeusi as one of his strongest supporters in the state even as he called for more collaborative efforts between the state government and the people in providing security in the rural areas. He said the Amotekun corps would continue to comb the forest in Ifon but urged the people of the area to give necessary support to the security agency. Chief Awani said the governorâ€™s visit helped to douse tension that gripped the town after the killing of Oba Adeusi. Awani explained that the late monarch had been at the forefront of the campaign to combat crimes in the town.
