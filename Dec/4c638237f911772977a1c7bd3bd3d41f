Speaking about the award, Fiona Hitchcock, Managing Partner at Hitchcock Michalski expressed her delight about the award and her work with Access Bank. “We are extremely elated about the international recognition our work with Access bank has brought to us. And in moments like this when the Nigerian government and players in the financial industry are striving towards closing the financial exclusion gap, we are particularly excited to be a channel through which many more unbanked populations can be reached”. We are proud of the impact our work is having in Nigeria and we are committed to creating more impactful initiatives across the country.
