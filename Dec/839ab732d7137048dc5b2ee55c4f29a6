In the US, both Dr Fauci and General Perna, commander of the Warp Speed operation, have mentioned that Vaccines will be available to all who want it but what about saying, ‘all people will get it’. There should be no pandering to those that are anti vaccinators when their ignorance will endanger others. The COVID pandemic has spread around the world, no one is immune from it yet and unless we get everyone vaccinated there will still be outbreaks. Dennis Fitzgerald, Melbourne, Australia
