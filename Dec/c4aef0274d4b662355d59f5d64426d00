By Chuks Okocha The 36 governors of the federation will today meet with President Muhammadu Buhari over security situation in the country. A source at the secretariat of the Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF) informed THISDAY last night that the meeting would take place by 3p.m. It was gathered that the governors had on Sunday forwarded their request to meet with the president to his Chief of Staff, Prof. Ibrahim Gambari. According to a source, “After the visit of the governors to Borno State to commiserate with their counterpart, Prof. Zulum, over the killing of rice farmers in the state by the Boko Haram insurgents and the meeting that followed, the governors resolved to meet the president. “In their last meeting on December 1, the governors variously complained on the worsening security situations in the country. The governors are saying that they are overwhelmed by the security challenges in the country.” The governors had said through a statement issued by the Head of Information and Publicity of NGF, Abdulrazque Bello Barkindo, that they would seek a security order in their meeting with President Buhari. It is also not clear if the governors would push for the sack of the Service Chiefs, whose tenure of office have since elapsed. Nigerians from all walks of life have been calling for the sack of the security chiefs and the appointments of new security chiefs that would inject fresh ideas into the security network in the country. In a communique issued last week, which was signed by the Chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF), Dr. Kayode Fayemi, who is also the governor of Ekiti State, the governors resolved to “meet with the president as soon as possible to address security challenges across the country, particularly in the light of the carnage in Borno State.”
