Duro Ikhazuagbe Super Eagles defensive midfielder, Wilfred Ndidi, 23, has been described as irreplaceable at Leicester City. Leicester City Manager, Brendan Rodgers, told the club’s website yesterday that Ndidi who is one of the top defensive midfielders in the English topflight covers more ground than any other player in the club. Ndidi has been in good form in the Premier League for Leicester since he returned from the groin injury that sidelined him since September. “He (Ndidi) covers the ground. In terms of counter-pressing, he’s so strong,” Rodgers said on the club’s official website. “He can get up to the ball so fast. If a team breaks through our midfield line, he can normally get back in and recover. “Of course, on set pieces, he’s very dominant. You can see, bringing him into the team, the profile he gives you in your box when you’re defending,” Rodgers continued. “From a defensive perspective, he’s irreplaceable with what he gives you, in terms of energy and desire to get the ball back. “Just his personality in the game is so great for us. It’s great to have him back. We’re obviously trying to manage his time coming back in there, but he’s a colossal player,” concludes the former Liverpool boss. Ndidi featured in the Foxes’ last two games which they won against Sheffield United and Brighton and Hove Albion. Ndidi, who has struggled with injuries this season, has played just four matches in the league this term for Leicester. The 23-year-old has been linked with Premier League giants Arsenal and Manchester United in the past.
