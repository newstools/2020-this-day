Businessman and philanthropist, Dr. Oludare Akande, is a man who is well known on Nigeria’s social radar. Besides, the financial expert sometimes ago created a sensation by the audacious unveiling of his multibillion-naira American Polytechnic of Nigeria (APN), with a permanent campus to be located on over 200 acres of land in Wasinmi Community in Araromi LCDA of Oyo State. On December 8, the Oke-Ogun, Oyo State-born achiever clocked the age of 40. Though the debonair philanthropist fondly called, ‘Obama,’ only marked the day with special prayers and thanksgiving with close family members and select associates in attendance, he has shifted what he planned to be a double celebration to 19 December when his American Polytechnic will be having its first public event —in form of a Christmas carol. On that date, the school’s temporary site located at the famous Adegoke Motors complex in Ibadan will roar to life as a popular gospel artiste, Tope Alabi, will headline the carol. She will be leading about 10 other top gospel artistes to minister to scores of eminent personalities, including royal fathers, top public office holders, celebrities, and socialites expected at the event. Akande will later cap the celebration with a formal lavish 40th birthday shindig on 26 December. At the special bash that will be held at the posh Mauve 21 Event Center, Ring Road, Ibadan, with Dr. Yinka Ayefele on the bandstand, many of his friends and associates, at home and abroad, will be around to celebrate this young man whose achievements belie his age.
