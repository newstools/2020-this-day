According to Umahi, “Our major revenue is expected to come from the Federation Account estimated at about N52billion or 42.33 percent of the budget. Other revenue heads like IGR, sales of international market stores, land proceeds, sales of malls, other receipts among others will account for the balance of N57.994billion or 47.53 percent of the total budget. We are projecting to increase our IGR from the projected N10, 569, 074,353 .56 in 2020 budget to N12, 858, 297,657.83 or 10.47 percent of our total expected revenue. “In 2020, our projected actual revenue receipt by December 31, 2020, is N122, 138, 799, 059.13 which is 92.53 percent performance.
