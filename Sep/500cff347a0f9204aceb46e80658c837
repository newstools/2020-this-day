The African Democratic Congress (ADC) has disowned the purported adoption of the Zenith Labour Party’s governorship candidate in Ondo State, Mr. Agboola Ajayi, by a group masquerading as ADC members in the state. The party said no member of ADC had joined any other party, while affirming its total confidence in its governorship candidate for the October 10, 2020 election in the state, Prince Dapo Adelegan. A statement, issued yesterday by the National Publicity Secretary of ADC, Yemi Kolapo, described the report as fake and utterly mischievous, in view of the fact that those involved are not known to either the state or national executives of the party. It said ADC’s popularity amongst Ondo indigenes, which had produced House of Representatives’ members, including, Hon. Abiola Makinde, could not be played up for pecuniary reasons by rascals in search of a political platform to actualise their sinister motives. The party said, “as a party with integrity, we distance ourselves from the purported adoption of another party’s candidate. Prince Dapo Adelegan, the governorship candidate of ADC in Ondo State, remains the best the state has to offer in terms of the promise to deliver the real dividends of democracy to the good people of Ondo State. “We stand solidly by our candidate and assure members and stakeholders of victory in the October 10, 2020 governorship election in the state.” It added, “ADC is not in competition with ZLP but focused on the Governorship race and determined to form the next government of Ondo State. Our politics is purpose-driven and we abhor violence. “This is the time to vote out non-performance, treachery, corruption, and poverty and embrace new, practical initiatives that will take Ondo State to the forefront of development in Nigeria. This is what Prince Adelegan is putting on the table.”
