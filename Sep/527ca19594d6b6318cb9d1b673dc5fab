By Laleye Dipo The Chief Whip of the Senate, Chief Orji Uzor Kalu, has said that the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) is yet to zone the presidency of the country to any of the zones in the country even as he insists that zoning is not in the constitution of the party. Kalu stated this in Minna, Niger State on Monday after paying a courtesy visits to two former Nigerian leaders — Gen. Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida and Abdulsalami Abubakar — as well as the state Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, and the Emir of Minna, Alhaji Umar farouk Bahago, at their residences. Kalu said the issue of which part of the country the presidency will go in 2023 will be decided at the appropriate time by the party. The chief whip however disclosed that he does not have any presidential ambition but if asked to contest for the president in 2023 “I will do so”. “At the moment, I am a senator, I want to continue to be a senator but if I am asked to contest for the presidency, I will be happy to do so,” he said. Kalu expressed sadness at the level of insecurity in the country, adding that: “I am sure the president is not happy too. “The government is doing everything to bring the situation to normal, we need to cooperate with the government “The National Assembly will also cooperate with the executive to find solution to the problem of insecurity in our land.” Asked to comment on the stand of the Senate on the call for the sack of the security chiefs as a result of the insecurity in the country, Kalu said: “I cannot speak for the Senate, the Senate has not taken a decision. When we meet, we will agree on the way forward.” Kalu said he was in Minna to rejoice with Gen. Babangida on his 79th birthday and to welcome back Gen. Abubakar back from abroad after a minor surgery. The meetings with the two former Nigerian leaders were held behind closed doors.
