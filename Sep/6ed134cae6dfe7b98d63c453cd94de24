By Onyebuchi Ezigbo The Colleges of Education Academic Staff Union (COEASU) has ordered its members to immediately withdraw their services from their schools. Addressing a press conference on Thursday in Abuja, COEASU President, Nuhu Ogirima, said that after series of efforts through several correspondences to get the federal government to attend to the demands of the federal colleges of education in the country failed to yield results, the union was left with no option than to commence a series of actions which will lead to full blown nationwide strike as soon as schools reopen. He said that the National Executive Committee of the union will be meeting to approve further actions to compel government to respond to their demands, which he said, included poor funding and neglect of infrastructure of the institutions.
