Commenting, Vice President, Visa West Africa, Kemi Okusanya said: “We are delighted to bring tailored offers to our cardholders so they can save when they pay with Visa. This reward program is one of the many ways we are showing our commitment to digitizing the Nigerian economy. We want to encourage Nigerians to replace all their physical cash transactions with cards which are more convenient and secure.” Okunsanya explained that habits have changed a lot within the past few months, as more and more people now prefer to shop from the comfort of their homes, noting that Visa’s Covid-19 impact tracker revealed that 71 per cent of Nigerians turned online for the first time during the pandemic. “eCommerce has continued to grow in Nigeria and this trend is likely to continue as the payments industry is witnessing an unprecedented acceleration of digital adoption. While online commerce has increased, in-store purchases have not gone away especially as lockdown restrictions are being gradually lifted. Some goods simply cannot be purchased online and delivered to consumers. In these situations, card payments can offer peace of mind and Visa is glad to make this possible,” Okusanya added.
