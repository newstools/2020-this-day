Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja The Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Otunba Adeniyi Adebayo, has denied speculations suggesting he is interested in contesting in the Ekiti State governorship poll in 2022. The minister stated this in a statement issued yesterday by his Special Adviser on Media, Mr. Julius Toba-Jegede, while reacting to the recent erection of some billboards across Ado Ekiti and other strategic locations in the state by some political groups, calling on him to join the race. Adebayo, who governed the state between 1999 and 2003, said while he appreciated the various calls from the group and other pressure groups, he would rather be focused on his current assignment as a minister, where he is helping President Muhammadu Buhari to achieve his goals for all Nigerians in this second term. He stated: “I am aware of the recent development of people agitating for me to contest the governorship of Ekiti State in 2022. With every sense of humility and respect, I want to thank them for believing in me. However, I must state clearly that I am not interested in the running for the office of governor of the state again. “As a leader, it was a privilege to serve the state as its first governor, where I did my best leaving behind verifiable legacy projects. My interest now is to continue playing my leadership role of ensuring that our dear state is peaceful, well governed, and to encourage the next generation of leaders to emerge. “At the federal level, I am currently engaged with the responsibilities of my office as a minister and how to ensure that the economic diversification goals of President Buhari for the country are achieved in his second term.”
