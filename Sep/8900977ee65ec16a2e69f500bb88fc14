It is pleasing to see that the Whitehouse Lawn is being repaired after the damage caused during the Republican National Convention which should never have been held there. Is there any truth that there will also be sand bunkers, tees and 18 holes added so that the President can devote more time to his main priority, Golf? Dennis Fitzgerald,
