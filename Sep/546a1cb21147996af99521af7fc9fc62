Candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in this weekend’s Edo election, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, said if elected governor, his administration will seek for debt forgiveness from lenders. Speaking Wednesday on The Morning Show on ARISE News where he and Governor Godwin Obaseki of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), the two main candidates in this weekend’s Edo election, are billed to discuss their vision, he said he would be relunctant to seek loans for projects that are not economically viable. He said that he would leverage on the people of the state who are well positioned in the Diaspora so that they could pull resources and invest in projects in the state. He said he was hoping that when he assumes office, if elected, the economic situation in the state will not be very bleak. Details later..
