Again, the chief mangler of the English Language, Donald Trump, has spoken about “Dark Shadows”, basically almost a tautology although his reference to police who “Choke” under “Tremendous Pressure” is nothing but offensive to everyone. Also, the logic of going to Kenosha, which is in mourning, defies common sense and could only be seen as a desperate appeal to his now diminishing support base. Perhaps he should take the advice of the President he speaks so highly of, Abraham Lincoln, who is quoted as saying “Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and to remove all doubt”.
