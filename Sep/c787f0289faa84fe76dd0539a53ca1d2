Rebecca Ejifoma Evercare Group, a healthcare delivery platform that operates hospitals, clinics, and diagnostic facilities across Africa and South Asia, has launched a telemedicine platform tagged, Ecare. Speaking on the launch, the Chief Medical Officer, Evercare Hospital Lekki, Dr. Ayo Shonibare said with the COVID-19 pandemic that has led to patients avoiding physical consultations in hospitals, there was no better time for virtual interactions than now. He said: “This platform was launched to help fill the gap by providing patients the ability to consult remotely and also give them the satisfaction of having the clinician interact with them face to face. “Evercare exists to serve growth markets like Nigeria that need access to quality, comprehensive care that seeks to improve patient outcomes while reducing costs and increasing efficiency. “As we seek to improve health outcomes for patients, we will provide the expertise and resources required to strengthen our model and drive enhanced multidisciplinary care delivery system.” He explained that the Ecare platform offers tele and video consultations with general practitioners and specialist doctors in various fields of medicine, adding that the platform brings about a change in the outpatient consultation model as it allows clinicians to reach out to their patients remotely via a video conferencing model to be able to address their healthcare needs. “It gives the patient the confidence, he said, of being able to have access to their Clinician in their time of need. “The platform has a two-way add on feature that allows the patient to invite a friend or family member on the consultation and at the same time permits the clinician to invite a colleague in case of a multi-disciplinary or complicated consultation,” he said.
