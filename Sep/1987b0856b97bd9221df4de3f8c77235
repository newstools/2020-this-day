The selection of the three companies followed a careful and painstaking evaluation of 282 entries in the NCC COVID-19 Virtual Hackathon from digital innovation Startups and Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) by an evaluation committee set up by the commission. The Executive Vice Chairman, Prof. Umar Garba Danbatta, presented the research grants to the beneficiaries during a virtual grant/prize award ceremony, which held in Abuja recently. The health and economic crisis triggered by the novel COVID-19 Pandemic had challenged the global ICT community to search for digital solutions to address and contain the spread of the virus.
