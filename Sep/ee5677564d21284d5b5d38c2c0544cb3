Omon-Julius Onabu in Asaba Traditional rulers in the country have been urged to be alive at all times to their fatherly role of championing policies and programmes that would bring about peace and development in the society. The Chairman of Delta State Council of Traditional Rulers, the Obi of Owa Kingdom, HRH Dr. Emmanuel Efeizomor II, made the appeal during a thanksgiving service to mark the 61st anniversary of his coronation at his palace grounds in Owa-Oyibu, the administrative headquarters of Ika North-East Local Government Area of the state. Efeizomor said their role as royal fathers placed great burden on them towards ensuring that there is peace and security in their respective domains and the society at large without which development and progress would be impossible. While expressing gratitude to God for the opportunity to preside over the throne of his forebears for over six decades and elevating him to a position of influence far beyond his traditional domain, the Owa king said he has been able to empower over 250 persons, including the physically challenged, less-privileged and indigent students. He also advised the youths particularly to take advantage of all opportunities in education and learning of skills as well as embrace reading culture. The monarch commended the state Governor, Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, for his administration commitment to human capital and infrastructural development policies and schemes. Several eminent guests at event, including the Onogie of Igueben, Edo State, HRM Ehizogie Eluojierior; the Obi of Ubulu-Unor, Delta State, HRM Dr. Henry Chikachukwu; the Obi of Idumuje-Unor, HRM Charles Ayansi III, and chaplain of the Owa Palace Chapel, Rev Benjamin Ebue, extolled the virtues of the Owa monarch, including his commitment to peace building and legendary transformation of the kingdom from a rural area to an enviable urbanised environment during his reign.
