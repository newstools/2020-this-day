The Imo State Governor, Senator Hope Uzodimma, said yesterday that the choice of who emerges presidential candidate in 2023 would be based on political party and not on the basis of tribe. Uzodimma said this in an interview with State House correspondents after a meeting he had with the President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. The governor said, “You know that the position is not vacant now; there is a sitting President and we are practising partisan democracy and not tribal democracy. “So, the emergence of presidential candidate will come on a party by party basis, not a tribe by tribe basis. “But if there are other internal factors that will form part of the considerations for parties taking decision, of course, that will be entirely the job of the leadership of those political parties and I think that is the right thing to do.” The governor said he sought Buhari’s intervention on the problem of erosion ravaging his state, which he described as alarming. He said the state was in dire need of the help of the Federal Government on the matter.
