Leicester City have signed Roma winger Cengiz Under on a season-long loan deal, with the option of a permanent transfer. The 23-year-old has made 88 appearances in all competitions for Roma, scoring 17 goals since arriving in 2017. Under, who has 21 Turkey caps, joins international team-mate Caglar Soyuncu at King Power Stadium. “I’ve always wanted to play in England and this is a great opportunity to play in the Premier League,” Under said. “I will try to help my team-mates on the pitch and off the pitch and I believe that I can improve my performance every day. I think I am fast and can create lots of chances for my colleagues. “I feel very good because my best friend plays for Leicester City. I am very happy to be able to play with Caglar and I always watched Leicester’s games because of him.” Foxes manager Brendan Rogers previously said the club needed a “different kind of attacking player”, adding that Under is a “very, very good player”.
