Cameroonian legend Samuel Eto’o has warned that it is imperative for Spanish giants FC Barcelona to reinforce their squad with more quality players rather than banking on Lionel Messi. This comes after the club’s captain Lionel Messi made a dramatic U-turn and stayed at Barcelona with the team having endured a disappointing 2019/20 season. Barca finished the campaign empty-handed having been embarrassed in the UEFA Champions League quarter-finals by Germany’s Bayern Munich, who won 8-2. Messi is widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time and the best player in the history of FC Barcelona. Eto’o, who played with the Argentine superstar at Barca between 2004 and 2009, explained what it is needed for the team to start winning trophies again. “I am happy because my son Messi has stayed at his house,” Eto’o told TuttoMercato. “But at Barca, we need other players with Blaugrana DNA. Messi alone is not enough. “You need to look for players on the market with tiki-taka style and not box to box,” Eto’o, said about Barcelona, who have a new manager in Dutch tactician Ronald Koeman. Koeman was part of Johan Cruyff’s “Dream Team”, helping Barca win La Liga four years in a row between 1991 and 1994, and the European Cup, where he scored the winning goal of the final against Sampdoria in 1992. Eto’o left Barcelona having netted 130 goals in 199 competitive matches and he also scored 56 goals in 118 international games for Cameroon.
