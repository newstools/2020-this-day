THISDAY Editorial of September 25, 2020 as titled above made interesting reading. Once again, it blamed everyone else but the gullible girls. This is why the problem seems intractable. If you must know, the problem of prostitution is 40% caused by gullibility of the girls involved, 30% by the pressure on daughters from average and poor homes to take responsibility for siblings and parents and 30% sexual pressures on the girls accentuated by drugs, alcohol, and related societal pressures. Why blame men who naturally have pressures to be satisfied for patronizing products available for sale?
