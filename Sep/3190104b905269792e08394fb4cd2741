Commenting on the performance of GTBank, analysts at FBNQuest said the PBT of N109.7 billion declined by five per cent and currently tracks behind management’s 2020 guidance of N235 billion. “Nevertheless, the results are still quite healthy considering that the guidance was provided before the full effect of the pandemic could be properly quantified. Given the magnitude of the earnings gap relative to guidance, we would not be surprised if management were to revise its FY 2020 PBT guidance downwards,” they said. Also commenting on the performance of Stanbic IBTC, FBNQuest said the results came in ahead of their expectations on almost all key headline items. “PBT beat our forecasts by around 29 per cent due to positive surprises in revenues and operating expenses. Further down the profit and loss, the positive surprise on the PAT line was even stronger at 106 per cent, thanks to a solid result of N12.9 billion in other comprehensive income,” analysts at the Lagos-based firm stated.
