Coronation Merchant Bank has launched a mobile banking application.
The app provides customers with easy access to their accounts as well as the ability to perform transactions seamlessly, without the need for in-person banking. The bank disclosed this in a statement.
It pointed out that in spite of the coronavirus, it has been at the vanguard of pioneering innovative solutions to enable its customers achieve their strategic objectives. Commenting on the launch of the new banking solution, Managing Director/CEO of Coronation Merchant Bank, Banjo Adegbohungbe, said, “We are delighted to be at the forefront of digital banking within the merchant banking space. “We recognise that these are very difficult times and our customers are looking for a partner that can help them navigate the challenges induced by the COVID-19 pandemic. “This is why we are constantly raising the bar and pushing the limits in service delivery by pioneering innovative solutions that make banking easier and faster for our customers.” He further stated that, “our goal is to consistently create value for our customers and to provide them with solutions that enable them meet their strategic objectives. “We remain committed to being there for our customers even in these difficult times.”
Earlier this year, the bank announced its partnership with the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group, to provide a $40 million trade finance guarantee facility for its clients. That was the first time in five years that IFC would approve such a facility in Nigeria.
Furthermore, the bank was recently appointed as a designated bank for the collection and remittance of all revenue payments (that is import, excise and other duties) by the Nigeria Customs Service.
