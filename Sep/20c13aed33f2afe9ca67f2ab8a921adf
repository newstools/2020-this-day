David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka The Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Anambra State, Mr. Ndubuisi Nwobu, has said that 12 members of the party have given notice of their intention to contest for the ticket of the party for the 20 21 governorship election. Nwobu stated this in Awka, Anambra State’s capital, during an interactive session with journalists, saying that the party has promised a level playing field for all the aspirants. He said: “We have given delegates’ lists to all persons that will run for governor in Anambra State on our platform. “This has never happened before. We are bent on ensuring that the right person who is elected by the people wins the ticket of the party for the election. “My name has been associated with a lot of aspirants, but truth is that I cannot do much. The aspirants should go to the field and convince our party men. They already know who the delegates to the primary election are. Before now, the list is only produced a day or two to the election, and usually compiled to favour one person or the other, but in this executive, we want to be fair to all. “This executive does not have a pay master and we do not pander to the whims and caprices of any pay master. That is why we do not have money to do some of the things we should do in this party because money bags who usually throw money about are not comfortable with us because we are not ready to do their bidding,” he said. He listed members of the party who have notified their intention to run for its ticket for the 2021 governorship election to include Mr. Harry Oranezi, Mr. Ifedi Okwenna, Mr. Emeka Azubogu, Mr. Valentine Ozigbo and Mr. Godwin Maduka. Others are Senator Uche Ekwunife, Mr. Obiora Okonkwo, Mr. Ike Oligbo, Mr. Emeka Etiaba, Mr. Godwin Ezeemo, Mr. Chuma Nzeribe and Mr. Ugochukwu Okeke.
