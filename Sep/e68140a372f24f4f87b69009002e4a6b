by Bennett Oghifo The production of the legendary Mitsubishi Pajero will be stopped by next year, gradually leaving the stage for the now popular Pajero Sport. This is after a successful 39 years run, and more than 3.3 million global sales of Mitsubishi Pajero. Regardless of the planned stop in production of Mitsubishi Pajero, Massilia Motors, the sole distributor of Mitsubishi Motors in Nigeria, has assured that it would still back up the model with quality after-sales support in terms of service and genuine parts. General Manager of Massilia Motors, Mr. Olatunji Itiola stated that “though Mitsubishi Motors Corporation has announced the end of production of the model next year, the Pajero will still be available for purchase till end of 2021 due to popular demand.’’ “We assure all our Pajero customers that Massilia Motors, known for its pedigree in after-sales backup, will continue to support the legendary Pajero with quality service and genuine spare parts.” Also, the Group Managing Director/Country Delegate of CFAO in Nigeria, Mr. Thomas Pelletier was recently recognised by the BusinessDay newspaper and the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) with the Next Bulls Award.
