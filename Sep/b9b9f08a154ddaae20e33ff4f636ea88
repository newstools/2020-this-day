Daji Sani in Yola The members of the Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics (ASUP) of the Federal Polytechnic Mubi (FPM), in Adamawa State, has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to constitute a Presidential Visitation Panel (PVP) that would carry out forensic audit of the institution’s finances over an alleged fraud. The Chairman of the ASUP, Mr. Hussaini James, told journalists yesterday in Yola that the PVP would unravel alleged financial malpractices of the eight year tenure of the ex-Rector of the FPM, Dr. Sadiq Yahya. James also called for the reconstitution of the governing board of the polytechnic that expired in May 2020 in order to checkmate the high level of financial profligacy and corruption in the institution. The chairman of the ASUP alleged that the former rector sacked about 100 staff of the polytechnic, including the National President of ASUP, Mr. Mohammed Ali Kabir, and his wife. He said: “Dr. Yahya also bought a Jeep for N29 million for his personal comfort, over bloated the salaries of some workers and (cost of) executing projects in the institution, which was usually handled by different departments instead of department of works alone. “It was on the wake of these impunities that the entire leadership of the union went to Yola Campus on September 4, 2020, to protest the ‘Kangaroo’ handing over that was done on September 3, 2020, in the night. “The union, therefore, called on President Buhari, the Minister of Education and key stakeholders in the education sector to intervene.” However sources in the FPM revealed that the ASUP and the former rector had a hostile industrial relationship for about eight years that deeply affected governance, management and administration of the academic institution negatively.
