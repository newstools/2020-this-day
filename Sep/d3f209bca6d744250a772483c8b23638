After a successful pilot run earlier in 2020, the sandbox of Ecobank Group is now live and accessible, on request, to the African fintech community. The sandbox allows fintechs to access Ecobank’s Application Programming Interface (APIs) for the development of innovative solutions.
The Sandbox is a major milestone for the Ecobank Group on its open banking strategy and it will accelerate partnership with fintechs and other partners across Africa. The bank’s Group Executive, Technology and Operations, Mr. Eddy Ogbogu, who disclosed this, stressed that, “as the pan-African bank, Ecobank is committed to the growth of the pan-African fintech ecosystem. “This sandbox is designed to facilitate this objective. Innovative fintechs, start-ups, product developers and technology partners are invited to leverage the platform to actualise their pan-African dreams.” Group Senior Fintech Advisor, Djiba Diallo noted that, “The Sandbox is designed to be relevant to the needs of the Ecosystem. There were really positive reviews from the pilot as well as some valuable feedback which helped in fine-tuning the platform for live launch.
“The pilot indeed helped both Ecobank and fintechs get the best out of the sandbox. We are excited about the new opportunities it brings to the ecosystem and customers.”
