Ebonyi State Governor, Mr. David Umahi, yesterday lifted the restrictions he slammed on all public gatherings in the state. In a statement issued yesterday by the Commissioner for Information and State Orientation, Uchenna Orji, the governor said he was exercising the powers conferred on him by the Ebonyi State COVID-19 and other Dangerous Infectious Diseases and Related Matters Law 005 of 2020. Umahi, had in the wake of the outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic in the country, placed restrictions on worship centres, event centres and other public places, apparently to curtail the spread of the virus. He added, “The lifting of the ban is in the exercise of the powers conferred on the governor by provisions of Ebonyi State COVID-19 and other Dangerous Infectious Diseases and Related Matters Law 005 of 2020 and other relevant Laws. “In this regard, therefore, the Governor has directed that all restrictions in respect of movement order on public burials/ wake keeps, weddings, conferences, meetings, festivals, religious services/ gatherings, etc are hereby lifted.” Umahi also directed the lifting of restrictions placed on public places such as event centres, bars, places of worship, educational institutions, public parks, night clubs, cinemas, viewing centres and other such public places. “That all restrictions on the conduct of business and commercial activities are hereby rescinded,” he added. He also reiterated that all public and private schools from primary to tertiary levels shall re-open on 5th October 2020. The governor, however, noted that all regulations in respect of wearing of facemasks, washing of hands, use of hand sanitisers and social distancing are still in force in public places, events and gatherings.
