The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has protested what it called “the clampdown” on its governors by security agents in Benin City, Edo state capital, ahead of Saturday’s governorship election. A statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, said the national leadership of the party, in a press conference addressed by the PDP National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, “alerted the nation and the international community of the security siege on PDP governors in theri lodging in Benin City.” The party expressed shock that security agents were detailed to surround where PDP governors were accomodated so as to harass and intimidate them. It said “whereas APC governors, including the governor of Kano state, Abdullahi Ganduje, his Imo state counterpart, Hope Uzodimma as well as the Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, are left free in the comfort of the residence of the sacked national chairman of the APC, Adams Oshiomhole in GRA, Benin City.” The statement said: “Our party considers this siege as provocative and completely unacceptable as there cannot be two sets of laws for the citizens of our nation. In as much as the APC governors are given the liberty to stay in Benin City, our governors must not be harassed or stampeded to leave the state. “At any rate, we are confident that our governors will not allow themselves to be stampeded.” It called on all stakeholders in the Edo governorship election, particularly the security agencies, to work towards a peaceful, credible, transparent, free and fair election on Saturday.
