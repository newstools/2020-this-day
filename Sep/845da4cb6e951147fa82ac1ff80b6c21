The Ondo State Governor, Mr. Oluwarotimi Akeredolu (SAN), has urged the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to be responsible and play issue-based politics. Akeredolu made the assertion while responding to a call by the PDP through its National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kola Ologbodiyan, to account for the funds donated to the state by corporate organisations and individuals to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic that is currently ravaging the world. The governor said he had already sent the full bank statement of the response funds account to an Abuja-based social accountability organisation, Follow The Money International, and urged the PDP to consult the organisation for a copy of the statement. Akeredolu said by making the full bank statement available to the public in line with the Freedom of Information Act, he has displayed that his administration has nothing to hide, urging the PDP to advise its state governors to tow the same path. Displaying the response of the Ondo State Government to the organisation who requested for the details of the donations and how the funds were expended, the governor said that his administration is rated fourth out of the 36 states of the federation by the World Bank’s Fiscal Transparency and Sustainability Index which is a testimony to his open-door policy. Responding to the PDP through his verified twitter handle, @RotimiAkeredolu, the governor said: “reach out to @4lowthemoney. We already gave them the entire bank statement. We are not 4th in the World Bank’s Fiscal Transparency and Sustainability Index for nothing. We have nothing to hide.”
