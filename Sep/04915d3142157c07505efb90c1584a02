By Francis Sardauna The newly appointed Sharia Court judges in Katsina State have been urged to be transparent and ensure speedy dispensation of justice in the discharge of their official responsibilities as contained in the provision of the law. The state Chief Judge (CJ), Justice Musa Danladi Abubakar, gave the admonition Wednesday while swearing in the 20 Sharia Court judges in Katsina. He said sanctions and severe punishment await any judge found wanting while discharging his obligations, and urged them to operate with the code of conduct for judicial officers. Abubakar equally urged them to be conscious of the integrity of the justice system by doing what is right as stipulated by the tenets of Islam. He, however, warned the newly appointed Sharia Court judges to desist from inflammatory statements and the use of social media during and after court proceedings. He said: “You must be conscious of your personal integrity and the integrity of the institution by being conscious of who you are now. “You must operate within the code of conduct for judicial officers and other constitutional provisions to enhance professionalism as anyone found wanting will be sanctioned. “We will not tolerate situations where judges will use the social media against the other person. When a judge behaves in a way that compromised his integrity, he will be committing misconduct.”
