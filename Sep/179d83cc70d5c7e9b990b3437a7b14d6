James Sowole in Akure Barely two months after he resigned from the cabinet of the Ondo State Governor, Oluwatotimi Akeredolu, the former Secretary to the Ondo State Government (SSG), Hon. Ifedayo Abegunde, last Sunday returned to the camp of the governor, pledging to support the re-election of his former boss. Abegunde had in June resigned his appointment and declared support for one of the governorship aspirants, Segun Abraham. But few hours to the primary of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Abraham announced his withdrawal from the race, which was won by the incumbent governor. The former SSG later switched support for another governorship aspirant, Olayide Adelami, after Abraham withdrew from the contest. Abegunde, last Sunday evening, met with Akeredolu at the Government House in Akure, and took pictures with his four fingers raised after the meeting. With his return to Akeredoluâ€™s fold, the former SSG will be joining political gladiators in Akure, the state capital, to lead the APC to victory in the forthcoming October 10, 2020, governorship election. It was gathered that Abegunde met with the governor along with the former Commissioner for Special Duties, Femi Adekanbi. A source said Akeredolu and Abegunde have settled their differences, stating that the former SSG would now be working with other APC faithful to ensure the victory of the APC and Akeredolu in the forthcoming election.
