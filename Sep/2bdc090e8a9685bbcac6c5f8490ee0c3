Nigerian forward, Moses Simon scored as Nantes came back from two goals down to share points at Saint-Etienne yesterday in the French Ligue 1. Saint-Etienne were cruising to their fourth straight win of the new season before the Super Eagles forward pulled back one for Nantes Teenage midfielder Adil Aouchiche netted from close range in the second minute after latching onto Yvan Neyou’s cross. Left back Yvann Maçon made it 2-0 for Saint-Étienne midway through the second half before Moses Simon responded with that strike to pull back one. Belgian forward Renaud Emond salvaged a draw with his first touch after coming off the bench. The 18-year-old Aouchiche made a tough choice leaving French champion Paris Saint-Germain. He could have been playing alongside Neymar and Kylian Mbappé this season, but intense competition for places would likely have restricted his chances. Saint-Étienne leads Rennes on goal difference with both sides on 10 points.
