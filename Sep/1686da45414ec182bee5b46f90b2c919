By Bennett Oghifo Jaguar and Land Rover are partners of World EV Day. The event celebrates and promotes electric mobility worldwide and connects stakeholders from across the industry with consumers to showcase the benefits of electrification and to encourage debate on a more sustainable future. A statement by the automaker said the automotive brands are working together to deliver Destination Zero, a mission to create a more sustainable future with zero emissions, zero accidents and zero congestion. Delivered through engineering and design creativity, customer-first culture and a readiness to be strategically bold, this vision is already a reality. One critical contribution to delivery of Destination Zero is the electrification of the brands’ respective product portfolios. Jaguar was the world’s first manufacturer to introduce a premium all-electric SUV with the I-PACE and continues to be at the forefront of electrification innovation through its involvement in the FIA Formula E championship. Land Rover now offers four segment-leading plug-in hybrid electric vehicles in its stable from the Land Rover Discovery Sport P300e premium compact SUV and the new Land Rover Defender P400e through to its flagship Range Rover P400e.
