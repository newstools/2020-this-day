Former MFM FC of Lagos forward, Stephen Odey, has completed a season-long loan transfer to French second division club Amiens SC from Belgian club KRC Genk. This followed a successful medical at the French club, who have an option to buy the striker after the loan. L’Equipe reported Odey is a direct replacement for winger Ulrick Eneme Ella, who is on his way to the Premier League in England. Odey, 22, has failed to establish himself at Genk since his move from Swiss side FC Zurich last summer in a deal worth 3.5 million Euros. It is believed that he did not enjoy a decent run in the team to prove himself. This season, he did not make the matchday squad for the team’s first four league matches and it was only a matter of time before he was on his way out of the club. He was also linked with another French second division club Guingamp as well as Turkish club Ankaragucu.
