David-Chyddy Eleke Anambra State Governor, Chief Willie Obiano, yesterday, presented 130 brand new Ikenga IVM SUV vehicles made by Nigerian vehicle manufacturer, Innoson Vehicle Manufacturing (IVM) to 130 traditional rulers in the state. The presentation is coming weeks after billionaire oil mogul, Prince Arthur Eze allegedly presented 12 Lexus 570 SUVs to 12 traditional rulers who were suspended for joining him to Abuja to see President Muhammadu Buhari. Eze had also accused Obiano of ill treatment to traditional rulers in the state by refusing to give five per cent of the stateâ€™s revenue to the traditional institution as had been agreed by the federal government. But Obiano while handing over the vehicle at Dr. Alex Ekwueme Square, Awka, the state capital, said it was to appreciate their efforts in entrenching development including security of lives and property at the grassroots. He also commended them for overseeing the successful execution of the N20 million community infrastructure (choose-your-project) at their respective communities, assuring that his administration would continue to provide for the traditional institution. Also speaking, the Commissioner for Local Government, Community and Chieftaincy Affairs, Mr. Greg Obi, said the traditional rulers were the bedrock and foundation for government achievement in all areas of the economy. Responding on behalf of the monarchs, the Chairman, Anambra State Traditional Rulers Council and Obi of Onitsha, HRH Alfred Achebe tasked colleagues on unity and loyalty to constituted authority, while pledging unalloyed support of the traditional rulers to the government.
