By Alex Enumah Justice Samirah Bature of the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) on Monday ordered a serving Senator, Elisha Abbo, to pay the sum of N50 million as compensation to Mrs Osimibibra Warmate for assaulting her last year, Abbo was caught in the act via a CCTV camera inside an adult toy shop in Abuja. Delivering judgment in a fundamental right suit brought against the senator on alleged assault of Warmate, in March 2019, Justice Bature condemned the senatorâ€™s conduct as a federal lawmaker, adding that he had failed to live by example. The civil judgement came weeks after a magistrate court found the senator not guilty of criminal assault. The police had arraigned Abbo before a magistrate court in Zuba, last year on a one-count charge for assaulting Warmate at a sex-toy shop in Abuja. Despite a video evidence of the incident, Abdullahi Ilelah, the magistrate, upheld the no-case submission filed by the lawmaker and dismissed the case. However, Warmate proceeded to file a fundamental rights suit marked CV/2393/19 before the FCT high court. Meanwhile, the senator has asked his lawyers to appeal the ruling.
