The Nigerian Music Industry Collective, which consists of legendary singer, Ebenezer Obey; and other heavyweights in the music industry like the President of Chocolate City record label, Audu Maikori; Obi Asika, Dare Fasasi, and others, have appealed to the Governor of Kano State, Dr. Abdulahi Ganduje, not to sign the death warrant of a singer, Yahaya Sharif-Aminu. Music executive and manager of Tuface Idibia, Efe Omorogbe, made the appeal on behalf of the group in Instagram. The singer, Sharif-Aminu, was accused of blasphemy against the Holy Prophet Mohammed and was subsequently sentenced to death under the Sharia laws in Kano State. Pleading on the singer’s behalf, Omorogbe posted a statement on his social media page on behalf of the group. Omorogbe appealed to the governor to use his ‘good office to influence the implementation of the rule of law, which has obviously been disregarded in this case.’ The story read in part, “Your Excellency sir, we have been informed that Yahaya has been scheduled to be executed in less than a week, and we will like to appeal to you to use your good office to influence the implementation of the rule of law, which has obviously been disregarded in this case. “Yahaya Sharif-Aminu is protected under the law, which gives him freedom of thought, conscience and religion, and protecting freedom of expression. We, as leaders of the Nigerian music and entertainment industry, are absolutely against this attempt to gag free thinking and expression and ask that justice is served by the over-ruling of this sentence and the dropping of all charges against him.” “We ask that you use your good offices to stop this act and release him from this unfair act.”
