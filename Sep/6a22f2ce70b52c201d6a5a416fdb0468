Segun James The immediate past Managing Director of Polaris Bank Limited, Mr. Tokunbo Abiru, and Mr. Obafemi Saheed have, respectively, emerged as the candidates of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for the Lagos-East senatorial district and Kosofe 2 House of Assembly by-elections slated for October. At the primary election held yesterday, which was by affirmation, the Chief Returning Officer, Mr. Ibrahim Masari, announced that Abiru recorded a total vote of 111,551 votes from the votes returned from the five local government areas comprising Lagos-East viz Epe, Ibeju-Lekki, Ikorodu, Kosofe and Somolu, covering 71 wards. The spokesperson for the state APC, Seye Oladejo, in a statement said Saheed scored a total of 34,012 from the six wards in Kosofe Constituency 2. He said, “With the emergence of our candidates, all is now set for the APC to contest and retain the respective legislative seats.” The senatorial seat became vacant following Senator Bayo Osinowo’s death on June 15, 2020, while the demise of Hon. Tunde Braimoh on July 10, 2020 created a vacuum in Kosofe Constituency 2 at the state House of Assembly.
