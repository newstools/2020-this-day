With Ghanaians being regaled with news stories that Nigeria’s economy is contracting, security of lives and property not guaranteed by the central government, and businesses packing out of Nigeria with Ghana as favourite destination, older ones over there will be bemused to remember the 1983 incident where many illegal immigrants, mostly Ghanaians were expelled from Nigeria through an executive order by President Shehu Shagari in an exodus-drive that has left its mark in the lexicography of Nigeria as “Ghana Must Go?” The designation “Ghana Must Go,” now used as descriptive term for a cash-store jute-like tough bag, has its origin in the very shameful circumstance because Nigerians parodied the Ghanaians as having no better carriage-bag for all their years of toil in-country than a cheap jute bag to transport all they had worked for in Nigeria. It is always with a sense of wry and dry humour and a heavy dose of guffaw that we chortled about “Ghana Must Go” in our national discourse. Those older Ghanaians who remember the shame brought upon their nation are now in positions to exact revenge on Nigerians especially now that Nigeria’s economy continues to plunge downhill.
