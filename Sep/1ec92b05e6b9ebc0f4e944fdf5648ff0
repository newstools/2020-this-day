By Yinka Olatunbosun A German Cultural institution, North-Rhine Westphalia KulturSekretariat has released the trailer to the documentary video which is a collage of contributions by the Alumni of the International Visitors Programme to share their thoughts on the situation in their home country. The video titled, “Culture in Times of Corona” was conceived on the reality unleashed on global cultural workers across the globe. The video features participants’ comments on how the Covid-19 pandemic has reshaped public life and the consequences for artists as well as theatres, cinemas, art institutions and festivals. All participants are alumni of the International Visitors Programme at different period over the past ten years. Some of them are musicians, painters, performers, arts and culture journalists amongst others. About 100 international guests have been visiting North Rhine-Westphalia every year since 2009 and forming good networks. It is expected that in the coming years, the focus of the program will be on maintaining international and inter-cultural networks. In 2019, a total of 16 programs were implemented on video art, dance, theatre, street art, literature, games and jazz music. The trailer is available on social media platforms and NRW’s vimeo channel.
