We are proud to state that as at mid-August, approximately 10,000 mothers have been touched and still counting, as we hope to continue with this exercise” The Public Relations Manager of Tolaram Group, Mrs. Omotayo Azeez- Abiodun stated that the initiative was thought of to remind Nigerians to lead a healthy life.
