StarTimes GO, an e-shopping channel on pay-TV platform StarTimes, has partnered top retail and tech brands to cushion the rising cost of living and help Nigerians meet their household and personal needs at more affordable prices. Via its maiden Black Friday, which begins tomorrow, shoppers will have the opportunity to buy select tech and household products with up to 50 per cent discount. The online sales will hold on StarTimes Facebook page. The goods on display are directly from manufacturers and StarTimes has partnered them to subsidise the goods, saving shoppers extra money as inflation mounts. Goods will be sold at their bottom prices, much lower than market price only during the Black Friday sales. Early birds will be gifted extra tech products for purchases made. The products on display include Tecno phones, female bags, blenders, smoothie makers, electric shaver; Lontor range of products which include energy-saving and power-surge LED bulbs, anti-surge power sockets, power banks, rechargeable mist fans as well as foldable and rechargeable reading lamps. Also on display are MINISO products, among others. Launched last week, StarTimes GO, an integrated e-shopping platform, offers audience access to a massive array of superior quality products, with great designs, at super cheap prices. Goods are directly delivered to the doorsteps of shoppers.
