Bandits have abducted nine people from Kusasu village in the Shiroro Local Government Area of Niger State. The armed men had stormed Kusasu market at the peak of transactions to restock their food items and other basic needs when they abducted their victims in the process. The bandits, who stormed the market in about 15 motorcycles, took their time to do their purchase before abducting their victims. Three days after, the abductors demanded 10m as ransom for the residents, including a man they killed while attempting an escape. The abduction of the people is coming after the police in the state arrested no fewer than five informants of the bandits and launched a manhunt for eight others, who were members of the communities in the Shiroro council. Also, two other bandits were arrested in Zumba Market with AK-47 rifles by the police in Zumba in the Shiroro LGA. The activities of the bandits had reduced drastically following the clampdown on their informants, until the recent abduction of two construction workers, and killing of three soldiers who went after the abductors. The state Police Public Relations Officer, Wasiu Abiodun, could not be reached at the time of filing this
report.
