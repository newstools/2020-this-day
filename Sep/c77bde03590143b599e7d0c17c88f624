Fayemi said the death of Aliu was a huge loss to the state and Nigeria in general given his contributions to the development of performing arts and the state. The governor described Aliu as a rare and extraordinary talent whose impact was felt in the entertainment industry locally and internationally. Fayemi said Aliu’s worth has been recognised by the Ekiti State Government during his first tenure when the late theatre practitioner was honoured with the Ekiti State Merit Award, and by the federal government as a Member of the Order of the Federal Republic (MFR). He further described the deceased as a multi-talented personality who functioned as an actor, dramatist, playwright, singer, film maker, producer, director, costumes and location manager and sculptor. The governor credited Aliu with producing blockbuster movies like “Iku Jare Eda,” “Arelu,” “Irinkerido,” “Yanpon Yanrin,” “Fopomoyo,” among others. He noted that the late culture icon was a promoter of Ekiti brand and was proud of his state of origin in the course of his 61-year-long career on stage. Fayemi said Aliu had etched his name in the sands of time and immortalised himself in the hearts and consciousness of the global theatre audience. The governor commiserated with the family and associates of the deceased urging them to be consoled by the good life he lived. “Baba lived an impactful life. He served our dear state, nation and humanity with the best of his creative talent. We shall miss him sorely but we are grateful to God for the legacies he left behind. May God grant the family the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss.” the Governor added.
