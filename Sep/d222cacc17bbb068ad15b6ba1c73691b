Global consulting firm, Foreign Investment Network (FIN), is set to hold a strategic session targeting growth and investment in the nation’s agricultural sector. FIN is charged with a mandate to facilitate Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and intra-African collaborations across sectors. The conversation followed the distraction in the agricultural industry, occasioned by COVID-19 outbreak, thus triggering market contractions. The discussion, which will be held virtually in collaboration with Project Capital+, sought to explore alternative ways to fund the sector and make it attractive to local and foreign investors. Organisers of the programme noted that a discussion of this kind was apt at this period to be able to drive the diversification plans of the federal government as oil prices continued to plunge. The discussion which is centred on the theme, “Attracting Finance to Agricultural Sector Projects in times of Crisis”, will also examine the sector’s prospects, including export opportunities, as activities are expected to take shape post COVID-19. Notable and grounded speakers have been lined up to simplify the topic of the discussion which is scheduled for September 29. Some of the identified speakers included: Chairman and Founder of Project Capital +, Victor Politis, Founder and Partner, Dem – Inter, Mark Lewis and Head of Energy and Natural Resources – Aelex, Soji Awogbade, amongst others.
