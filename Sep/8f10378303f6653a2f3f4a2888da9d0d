We the leaders and people of Kwali Area council in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja thank President Muhammadu Buhari and the Minister of the Federal Capital Territory, Mallam Mohammad Musa Bello for nominating our son and immediate past chairman of Kwali Area Council Hon. Joseph Shazin as a member of the National Population Commission. The nomination is a recognition of the community’s contributions to the development of the federal capital and Nigeria in general. Kwali Area council is famous across the globe as the homestead of the late Dr. Ladi Kwali, a great pottery maker. Her pottery works have been displayed in major cities of the world and brought recognition to Nigeria at different times. We members of the community believe that Hon. Joseph Shazin will utilize his many years of experience as an administrator and two-time chairman of Kwali Area Council in discharging the responsibilities of his new national assignment. Since the creation of Abuja as the country’s capital, this is another occasion that the federal government has hearkened to our clarion call for recognition at the federal level and promised to support the programmes and policies of the APC-led administration. We are glad that our dream has come to fruition due to the pragmatic approach that the current FCT Minister, Mallam Bello has brought to governance. Apart from spearheading the accelerated development of the Federal Capital Territory, the minister has also brought development to the rural areas as well as given human face to governance. We hereby pledge our continued support and loyalty to the federal government and FCT administration at all times and appeal to the federal government to cite more federal projects in the Kwali area council.
