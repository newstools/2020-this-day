The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) has commended Red Star Express Plc, one of Nigeria’s logistics solution providers, for its collaboration, professionalism, as well as the synergies with its officers posted to the establishment to ensure that packages passing through the system are without drugs or any banned item. In a special message to the company, the Deputy Director, Operations and General Investigation, Ulo Okon, on behalf of the NDLEA, said co-operation from Red Star Express Plc had resulted to a great number of seizures of hard drugs. “I must confess that your support and assistance, in respect of this, is very wonderful and has resulted to a great number of seizures of hard drugs, fake documents, passports as well as fake travelers cheques; both in regular searches and controlled delivery process. “The agency is proud to be associated with Red Star Express Plc and further wishes that this collaboration will be part and parcel of the system culture”.
NDLEA stated that 33 seizures were recorded recently. The items were made up of cannabis, cocaine, Methamphetamine, fake passports, ATM cards, travellers cheques and money orders; adding that these items were intercepted and seized at Red Star Express office. The seizures further led to controlled package deliveries in Enugu, Abuja, Ibadan, and various locations within Lagos where eight persons were arrested and are now facing trial. Red Star Express Plc is a Licensee of Federal Express (FedEx) Corporation, the world’s largest delivery solutions provider.
