Yinka Olatunbosun A mega entertainment outfit in the Eastern part of Nigeria, Blacksheep Entertainment, has continued to rock the entertainment industry and fun seekers with a fun party groove. Called “Wet, Wild N’ Wasted project, it was unveiled to the media recently. The Blacksheep Entertainment Company known for developing quality and creative contents, and also sponsoring budding artists is fast becoming a force to reckon with in the industry. “With the array of events recently organised by us that include ‘My Confessions 4.0’, our support and sponsorship to the South Eastern Concert and Award namely “Deeper Laugh Oko” and “Soundsplash Awka”, the latest, which is “Wet, Wild N’ Wasted, promises to be the beginning of greater things to come,” says Oscar Whylle, Project Manager, Blacksheep Entertainment. Oscar Whylle also noted that for Blacksheep to have come this far in the industry there must be some beautiful minds behind it. Most entrepreneurs in the entertainment scene stay behind the limelight to project artists and the management of Blacksheep Entertainment is no exception to the rule. “The upcoming show is definitely going to be the talk of the town and we promised to give out our best,” says Whylle.
