Rebecca Ejifoma Talented and fast-rising singer, Adeyale Henry, with stage name Remy Crown, is a force to reckon with in the Nigerian music scene for his unique vibe and culture as he drops his near hit single, ‘Remynize’ Remy Crown has a perfect romance with afro pop and traditional folklore, which he plans to use to strike the right cords for music enthusiasts. Commenting on his new singles, the soulful artiste said, “My songs speak about positive vibes, more of motivating my audience. I’m trying as much as possible to do the best I can and not try to be like someone else”. Just like his name “Remy”, the singer has one quest. “I want to remynize (be myself ) in everything I do. I want my music to pierce the souls of my listeners. My team is currently working diligently to make the brand well known.” It is interesting to note that Remy Crown’s style is predominantly African. When asked how his news songs will impact his agog music fans, the fine musician enthused boldly, “Definitely, I’m going to make impact, trying to make all women around the globe feel special and not weird”. “Be yourself. You are perfect just the way you are. Don’t compare your life, your destiny, or your vision to others,” he encouraged.
