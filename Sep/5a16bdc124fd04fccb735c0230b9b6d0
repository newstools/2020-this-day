Bennett Oghifo A petrol laden truck fell and burst into flames at the Anthony Village/Gbagada axis of Lagos yesterday at about 10:30p.m.
The Director General of the Lagos State Lagos State Emergency Agency, Dr Olufemi Oke-Osanyintolu, who confirmed the accident, stated that two vehicles were burnt in the process. When THISDAY contacted him for updates on the accident at about 1:08a.m., he said the fire had been put out and that they were now engaging in recovery. However, shortly after the fire started, Oke-Osanyintolu had said, “The Agency responded to distress calls and upon arrival at the scene of the incident, it was discovered that a tanker with unknown registration number conveying petroleum lost control while in motion and subsequently fell sideways. “This led to an explosion in which two unidentified vehicles were burnt. A joint team of responders led by LASEMA, LASG fire service, LRU fire unit, Nigeria Police, and LASTMA are working together to curb the inferno from escalating further.”
He also said, “Casualties cannot be ascertained at this time. Rescue operation ongoing.”
