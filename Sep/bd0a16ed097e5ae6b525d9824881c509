By Chiemelie Ezeobi The Chairman, Nigeria Police Trust Fund (NPTF), Suleiman Abba, during his recent tour of police barracks in Ijeh and Police College in Lagos, said the trust fund will not hesitate to demolish police barracks that are in distress and below habitable standard for policemen nationwide. During his assessment of Ijeh Barrack on the Lagos Island, he said: “What I am seeing today is a dilapidated barracks…if not that I don’t have where to put them today, I would have relocated them (policemen), knocking down one or two and rebuild the barracks to a human habitable status.” Bemoaning lack of water, leaking roofs in almost all the barracks, he equally promised to “renovate the barracks that are still good to a human habitable status, with the provision of modern toilets, flowing water, safe roofs where water will no longer leak into rooms, safe electricity…that’s what a policeman deserves”. The erstwhile Inspector General of Police who had the following officers in his entourage; the Commissioner of Police, Lagos State, CP. Hakeem Odumosu; Commissioner of Police in charge of Works, Department of Logistics and Supply; CP. Aliyu Abubakar; Area Commander, Area ‘A’ Lion Building, ACP. Bode Ojajuni and others, evaluated the state of dilapitation of Ije Barracks at Obalende area, Mopol 20 Police Barracks and the Police College at Ikeja. He further emphasised that the present President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration has deemed it fit to unprecedentedly initiate the trust fund in order to improve and place the Nigeria Police ahead of her global counterparts especially in the areas of trainings, welfare, logistics and a host of others, for a more efficient security service in the country.
