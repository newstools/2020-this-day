The National Association of Nigerian Nurses and Midwives (NANNM) has handed a two-week ultimatum within which the federal government should reverse the increase in the price of fuel and electricity tariffs or face an indefinite strike. The NANNM expressed these decisions in the directive signed by its General Secretary, T.A. Shettima, issued to its State chairmen and Secretaries and sent to journalists in Abuja yesterday. The document reads, “I write to forward herewith the communique issued at the end of the Central Working Committee of the NLC held on September 16 2020. “In summary, the meeting discussed the unprecedented hike in the cost of petrol (and) the outrageous increase in electricity tariffs. “The meeting resolved to issue a 14 days ultimatum to the Federal Government within which to reverse the increases or face an indefinite strike. “You are by this letter directed to start mobilisation and sensitisation of our members. We shall keep you posted on any further development in this regard.”
