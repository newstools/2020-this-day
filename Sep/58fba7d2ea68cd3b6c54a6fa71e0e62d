The Governor of Lagos State, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu yesterday inaugurated the members of the Lagos State Task Force on Human Trafficking to curb the menace of human trafficking and irregular migration in the state. Speaking during the inauguration of the task force at the Lagos House, Ikeja, Sanwo-Olu urged all members of the task force to see their appointment as a call to service. The governor also charged them to come up with brilliant ideas, innovations and policies that will assist the state government in curbing the menace. He said: “The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed and exacerbated many global inequalities and plunged many economies like ours into recession, leaving millions of people at greater risk of being trafficked for sexual exploitation, forced labour, forced marriages and other crimes. What this implies is that the pandemic has created more economic difficulties for many especially women, young ladies and children who are the most vulnerable and might become exposed to the perils of human trafficking in a bid to seek better lives. “In view of this, I strongly believe that this initiative of constituting State Task Forces on Human Trafficking could not have come at a better time than now when it is needed more than ever that we put human dignity and human rights at the forefront and governments across all levels need to join hands and make collaborative efforts to put an end to the scourge of human trafficking. “The government and people of Lagos State understand the value of partnership as an inestimable tool in combating the transnational organised crime of human trafficking and as a result, we use this opportunity to assure you of our unwavering support, collaboration and strong partnership in providing all that is needed to ensure we bring an end to the menace of human trafficking in our society.”
