By Adibe Emenyonu The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Edo State has raised the alarm over the alleged arrival of thugs in the state capital, Benin-city, yesterday night and the alleged recruitment of thugs loyal to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the state Governor, Godwin Obaseki, stating that the latest alleged recruitment occurred in Warri in Delta State. This was revealed in a statement by the Publicity Secretary of the state APC, Mr. Chris Azebanmwani, who said the alleged thugs gained entrance into Benin-city and that more are ready to arrive in the city. He disclosed that: “One of my good sources in Delta State called me and told me that our election will be “bloody”. He told me that thugs in Delta State are currently mobilising. He has some of them in his contact, and that Obaseki is looking for more thugs. Some of them have already taken off from Warri yesterday and more will be leaving there in morning. These are people that were given clear instruction on what to do once they enter Edo State. They will lie low and carry out some kidnappings then unleash myhem on Saturday morning.” On the direness of the situation, Azebanmwan said: “The security agencies that have been deployed in the state and the resilience of our people will nullify all the thugs that the governor is bringing in. People are so tired of Obaseki that they actually believe that the governor’s second term must not be. Second term with the man is as good as packing out of Edo State. His governance is like giving gun to a baby to play with, so the people will come out to collect the power of Edo State from him.”
