The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has said the candidates participating in the September 19 governorship election in Edo State will sign a peace accord on Tuesday. The Chairman of INEC, Prof Mahmood Yakubu, made this known yesterday during a briefing of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 in Abuja. Mahmood also said about 17,000 ad hoc staff would be recruited for the election, noting that the PTF guidelines and safety measures would be strictly obeyed as the commission was going to operate a ‘no face mask, no voting policy’ at the poll.
