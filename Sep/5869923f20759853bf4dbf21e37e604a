David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka Anambra State Governor, Chief Willie Obiano, has disclosed that the state international cargo airport located at Umueri will be inaugurated in April 2021. Obiano stated this yesterday while performing the official groundbreaking ceremony of the Anambra Luxury Place Estate, a public, private partnership (PPP) project between the state government and Rotech Energy Services Limited in Nkwelle, near Onitsha. “The Anambra State international cargo airport will be inaugurated in April next year. It will be one of the best in the country,” Obiano said, as he encouraged the people to invest in the luxury estate, saying the Nkwelle GRA project is just a 10 minutes’ drive from the airport. “The airport is just a 10 minutes’ drive from here (Nkwelle), and a few kilometres to Onitsha town. It is strategically located and is a worthwhile investment,” he added. He praised the promoter of the project, Chief Austin Oguejiofor, who is the Chairman/Chief Executive of Rotech Energy Services Limited, for heeding to his government’s ‘Aku Luo Uno’ call, urging Anambra people, who have created wealth outside the state, to also consider investing in Anambra State.
