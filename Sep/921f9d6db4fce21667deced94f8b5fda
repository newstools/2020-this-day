By Alex Enumah Justice Taiwo Taiwo of the Abuja Division of the Federal High Court has restrained the Inspector-General of Police (IG) and the Delta State Police Commissioner from arresting or detaining a former Minister of State for Education, Olorogun Kenneth Gbagi, over allegations bordering on inhuman treatment and assault. Justice Taiwo gave the restraining order while delivering ruling in an exparte motion brought before the court by the former minister. Respondents in the enforcement of fundamental rights suit marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/1267/2020, are the IG and the Delta State Police Commissioner. The police had declared Gbagi wanted for allegedly stripping four of his employees naked over alleged missing money. However the former minister had in the exparte motion prayed the court to stop his arrest pending the hearing and determination of his main suit. In halting Gbagi’s arrest, the court also granted him leave to serve the originating processes and all other subsequent processes in the suit on the CP by substituted means. Justice Taiwo in addition held that the defendants, “are at liberty if they wish to file their response jointly and/or severally within 14 days.” He subsequently adjourned till October 16 for hearing. In the suit filed on September 28, Gbagi had also sought an order directing parties to maintain status quo, pending the hearing and determination of the application for the enforcement of the fundamental rights of the Applicant. The alleged stripping incident happened on September 18 and Gbagi, a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) had since denied any wrongdoing.
