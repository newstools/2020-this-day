Vanessa Obioha Due to the restriction on social gathering caused by the strange coronavirus, the leading telecommunications giant in Nigeria MTN hosted a virtual concert for the 2020 graduating set of the Musical Society of Nigeria’s (MUSON) School of Music on Monday, August 24. The show tagged ‘Evening with MUSON Stars’ had performances by graduates of MUSON who gave the show of their lives! Various medleys by foreign and Nigerian acts such as Duduke by Simisola ‘Simi’ Kosoko; Ma Gbagbe Mi by S. K. Oretimehin and Czardas by Vittorio Monti were performed to an entranced audience. The graduating students had the pleasure to perform ‘Gloria Cum Sancto Spirito’ and ‘Ise Orin n’ise wa’ with Sir Emeka Nowkedi as the Conductor and Tunde Sosan at the piano. The MUSON has organised graduation concerts for final year students for the past twelve years, however, this was the institution’s first virtual graduation. The students performed live from the Shell Hall of the MUSON Centre while observing strict social distancing procedures. Classical music fans across Nigeria were intrigued by the pieces the youngsters created with classical music this year. It was also an opportunity for curious fans of other genres of music to experience music at its purest. The graduates are beneficiaries of the MTN and MUSON’s Scholars Programme which has provided 300 scholarships to passionate music students. Calls for applications for the 14th edition are ongoing.
