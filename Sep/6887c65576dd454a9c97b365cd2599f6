Mary Nnah As part of its contributions and altruistic obligation towards enabling a better future and balanced learning environment for kids, Ayo Charity Foundation gifted The
Nigerian Red Cross Society, Makoko, Lagos a standard basketball court, equipment, and food donations. Established in 1964, The Nigeria Red Cross Society, is home to young children and an organisation that caters to the needs of the abandoned, missing, motherless, and the
homeless in the society. The presentation which took place last month witnessed the presence of volunteers from Ayo Charity Foundation, media, caregivers from the society, and most importantly
the children of the home. Speaking at the event, the Matron of the Nigerian Red Cross Society, Lagos Branch, Mrs. Olalu Caroline said “The initiative was a welcomed idea and very timely, as the children always wanted to engage in sporting activities. I want to use this opportunity to thank Ayo Charity Foundation for providing the kids with a sense of belonging.” Founder of Ayo Charity Foundation; Ayodeji Egbeyemi said: “Basketball is a tool. The reason I’m doing is to provide opportunity! If I didn’t get the opportunity to be introduced to the game, I wouldn’t be where I am today. Basketball changed my life, gave me free college and a master’s education, and an opportunity to work with professional athletes. I would like all kids in Africa to have that same opportunity.” The opening of the court was the highlight of the day as the children were introduced to the game of basketball, alongside an interactive orientation exercise by Coach Dele Awonuga, which saw them engage actively and excitedly. It was indeed an avenue to foster their interests in sports, and also present a sense of belonging and normalcy in the life of the children. Ayo Charity Foundation founded by Ayodeji Egbeyemi was created to provide life-changing opportunities, through the game of basketball, for the youth in Africa and
around the world.
