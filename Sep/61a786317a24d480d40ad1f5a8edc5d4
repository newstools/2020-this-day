The Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami, the Executive Vice Chairman of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Prof. Umar Danbatta, and other key players in the country’s Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector are set for the 2020 Nigeria Internet Governance Forum. The ninth edition of the annual event, which will hold virtually this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, is scheduled for September 23rd to 24th, with the theme: ‘Achieving Inclusive Digital Economic Development in the Post-COVID19 Era’. The forum will be chaired by the Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy, Mr. Istifanus Musa.
In a statement, the organisers observed that the COVID-19 pandemic had exposed the critical importance of digital technologies in fostering inclusive national development and this necessitated the thematic focus of the conference, where the Nigeria Internet Governance Forum Multi-stakeholder Advisory Group, the body of organisers of the event, will come together to discuss the way forward, as a community of Nigeria’s internet ecosystem. The theme of this year’s event amplifies how the focus of the group, from both the business and policy communities, is shifting from shaping a resilient Internet for societal sustainability to understanding the effect and impact of COVID-19 on individual and corporate lives and activities, especially with regard to women and the youths. While the group has assured of a good virtual experience at the programme, it said that the virtual conference would be preceded by the Youth Internet Governance Forum and Women Internet Governance Forum on the first day of the conference, while the main event at which Dr. Pantami will deliver a keynote address on the theme holds on the second day.
