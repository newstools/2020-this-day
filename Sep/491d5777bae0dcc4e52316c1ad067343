SWEET POTATOE is all about being emotionally attached to a girl. LUDO was inspired by WandeCoal and it really brought out the sound in Koloflow. Slow Mo is like an anthem for every single soul out there on the street chasing their dreams even when they should sleep. MAMACITA from the beginning to the end of this particular song is a spectacular view of attributing a young, beautiful, and well-nurtured lady with what a man wants. It entails the summary of love and passion for oneself towards another. ENITAN is just like the saying, what a boy sees while standing on an Iroko tree, an elder can see more even while sitting on the ground.
