Sources said the incident occurred on Sunday as he was being conveyed on a bike to his farm, located somewhere around Kiduni village in Chikun Local Government Area of the state. The bandits were said to have opened fire on them, killing the bike man on the spot, before taking the council boss. “The chairman was kidnapped on his way to the farm on Sunday. The farm is located somewhere around Kiduni in Chikun LGA. I understand that a bike man was taking him to the farm. The bandits shot at them and killed the bike man and kidnapped the chairman,” the source said. The spokesman of the Kaduna State Police Command, Mr. Mohammed Jalige, did not respond to telephone calls nor to the text message sent to his mobile phone, when contacted. Kaduna is one of the states facing serious security challenges, occasioned by incessant invasions of communities and abductions for ransom. Many residents around the suburbs of Kaduna metropolis, especially, residents of places like Damishi, Juji, Maraban Rido and Karji are said to have relocated from their homes to safer places following rampant cases of invasions and abductions in their communities by gunmen.
