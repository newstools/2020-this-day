By Omololu Ogunmade In contrast to the earlier statement issued by the presidency, President Muhammadu Buhari will make independence broadcast to the nation on Thursday at 7am. A statement earlier issued by the president’s media aide, Mr. Femi Adesina, had said the president’s address to the country, as part of activities commemorating its 60th independence anniversary, would be delivered at Eagle Square during the anniversary celebration, starting at 10 am. However, another statement issued much later, by Adesina, said “this updated statement supersedes our earlier one indicating an open-air live presidential address on October 1.” The updated statement enjoined all television, radio and other electronic media outlets to hook up to the network services of the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA) and the Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria (FRCN) respectively for the address. It added that the president would after the broadcast, proceed to the Eagle Square to review the anniversary parade and participate in other anniversary activities that will be covered live by major television and radio stations.
