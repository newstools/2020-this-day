Peter Uzoho The Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) has issued directives to deepen the utilisation of domestic Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) commonly known as cooking gas, Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) and Autogas as alternative fuels for Nigerians. The Director of DPR, Mr. Sarki Auwalu, stated this in his interaction with stakeholders in Lagos recently, saying that the directives were in furtherance of the federal government’s aspirations to provide affordable fuels and ensure domestic gas penetration and expansion in Nigeria while entrenching price freedom for Nigerians. The director in a statement by the agency’s Head of Public Affairs, Mr. Paul Osu, further said that DPR had carried out nationwide audit of all retail outlets and categorized them into three categories – 1, 2 and 3 – with a view to ascertain readiness for deployment of Add-On facilities for gas products. Auwalu stated that about 9,000 retail outlets which represent 27 per cent of total number of retail outlets in Nigeria are in Category 1 and have been identified as suitable for immediate integration of Add-On facilities based on robust safety assessment and technical considerations by DPR. He said the department had directed that all Category 1 Retail Outlet Operators are to commence immediate installation of modular Add-On facilities or full-scale stand-alone plants and update their DPR Operating licences accordingly. He said all operators of retail outlets in categories 2 and 3 whose facilities do not meet the minimum requirements or do not have sufficient land area are encouraged to apply for stand-alone LPG, CNG, LNG or Auto Gas facilities (full-scale or modular) under an incentivized regulatory regime. Auwalu, disclosed that DPR had also approved the deployment of skid-mounted modularized/containerized LPG/Autogas handling systems and other intrinsically safe systems for gas storage and handling to promote affordability, accessibility, and availability of the products.
