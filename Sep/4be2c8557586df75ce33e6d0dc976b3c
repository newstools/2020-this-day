Martins Ifijeh 200 staff of the Lagos State Environmental Protection Agency (LASEPA) have benefited from a free medical eye screening exercise organised by the General Manager, Dr Dolapo Fasawe in conjunction with Kingstripes Care Foundation. Speaking on the two-day screening exercise, tagged ‘Enabling Clearer Vision for a Cleaner Environment” and held in Lagos recently, Fasawe said this would help the staff contribute their quota better to the society. She said: “Good health is a universally understood language that cuts across individuality or educational level. The eyes are the windows by which we see and appreciate nature and the environment, therefore any delay in seeking medical intervention or unattended visual ailment, could lead to total blindness, hence the need to educate the staff on eye care. “As a seasoned public health professional, i observed through my encounter with the staff, that as a result of failing vision, they often produced suboptimal results, which informed my major inspiration for the Free Eye care Program to further engage and inspire them for better performance for the betterment of the environment.” According to her, the physical, social and mental health of the staff is a key welfare point and since the environment plays vital roles in determining the good health and wellbeing of the people, thus,the importance and mutual inclusiveness of these respective factors must complement for a positive outcome. She disclosed further that over 200 staff benefitted from free eye checks, consultations, distribution of reading glasses and medicals at no cost. Adding that the success of the inaugural edition has encouraged her to make it an annual event.
