Ejiofor Alike A former Governor of Enugu State and Senator representing Enugu East in the Senate, Dr. Chimaroke Nnamani has showered encomiums on Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State for what he described as his relentless effort and commitment towards the rehabilitation of the Akanu Ibiam International Airport, which was reopened recently after one year of closure. In a statement issued yesterday in Abuja, Nnamani stated that, “it is ennobling that Governor Ugwuanyi has lived up to expectation of overseeing the primary and central city of Igbo land. Not only did he coordinate, organise and champion the activities, he was directly involved on a daily basis in the rehabilitation of the airport project”. He praised Ugwuanyi for the bold steps taken to relocate the Emene market abattoir, Enugu State Broadcasting Service (ESBS) mast and other structures that were hitherto obstructions to smooth operations at the airport. Nnamani said he was pleased that Ugwuanyi who now leads the Ebeano political family, has demonstrated statesmanship, courage and leadership as the governor of the coal city state that is now a pride to Igbo land. According to him, “I welcome with excitement the news of the reopening of the Akanu Ibiam International Airport that serves as the gateway to the Igbo area of Nigeria. “This is consistent with the role expected of the Governor of Enugu State to symbolise total Igbo social and cultural appropriation of the city of Enugu”. The former two-term Governor of Enugu State recalled that as a governor “I ensured that the portraits of the Governors of the five Igbo States; Abia, Anambra. Ebonyi, Enugu and Imo are displayed at the Executive Lounge of the Airport. He reiterated that Ugwuanyi’s style of leadership anchored on equity and justice has sustained and indeed improved on the peace, unity and development of Enugu State.
