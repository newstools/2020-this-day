Kasim Sumaina in Abuja The approval granted Emirates Airlines by the federal government to operate into Nigeria after the recent reopening of Nigeria’s airspace to international operations, has been reversed effective Monday, September 21, 2020. The Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika, while announcing the reversal Saturday through his official Twitter handle noted: “Emirates Airlines’ situation was reviewed & (and) they are consequently included in the list of those not approved, with effect from Monday the 21st Sept. 2020.” Sirika had, last month, said that the Government of Nigeria has resolved to activate the principle of reciprocity on countries that placed restrictions on Nigerians. The minister also on Friday revealed that the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 sub-committee met with the European Union Ambassadors to Nigeria to discuss Lufthansa, Air France and KLM flight restriction to Nigeria. According to him, “The PTF sub committee met today with EU Ambassadors to discuss Lufthansa, Air France/KLM ban. The meeting progressed well.” To this end, Sirika reiterated that the airlines that will be affected still include Lufthansa, Air France, KLM and Etihad Airways, while other airlines restricted were as a result of non-resumption of international flight and non-compliance with Foreign Carrier Operating Permit (FCOP).
