Diego Armando Maradona Junior, the son of an Argentina legend by the same name, is tipping Victor Osimhen to take the Italian Serie A by storm in his debut season with Napoli. Napoli’s most expensive signing in history, Osimhen caught the eye in his two pre-season games, scoring back-to-back hat-tricks to help the Blues defeat L’Aquila Calcio 1927 and Teramo. Maradona has highlighted the qualities of Osimhen but on the flip side the former Italy U17 international expressed concern about his link-up play. Writing in his column in Repubblica via gonfialarete.com, Maradona Jr. stated : “He is a forward with a great prospect, he has hallucinating room for improvement. “If put in the right conditions, he can become a 30 goal striker. He’s just 21. I have expressed some doubts about his construction phase when it comes to tie up the game. “He doesn’t have to do it too much, it doesn’t have to be his first goal. He is good at attacking depth and if he has space in front it hurts. “He must be put in a position to kick many times on goal. Once he can be wrong, not the second”. Osimhen finished with 18 goals in all competitions for Lille last term and netted 20 during his loan spell with Sporting Charleroi in 2018-19.
