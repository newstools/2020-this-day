Italy international, Matteo Politano, has urged Napoli fans to be patient with the club’s record acquisition Victor Osimhen, stressing that the Nigerian striker has joined the team from a different championship. Osimhen showed glimpses of his enormous potential in his non-competitive debut for Napoli, scoring a hat-trick inside eight minutes as they demolished L’Aquila Calcio 1927 11-0 in a three-team tournament also involving Castel di Sangro. “Osimhen has great prospects, he’s a good guy and has to work calmly,” said Politano to Sky Sport Italia (via Tuttomercatoweb). “You shouldn’t expect everything immediately, it comes from a championship that is different from the Italian one. “He has potential, it’s up to him to put it into action. We are happy to have him on the team and we will give him a hand.” Politano is hoping that Osimhen can become a top level striker in the Serie A but cautioned that pressure should not be put on him. ” It is our wish, it is of perspective and has a great leg. He is irrepressible, we should put him at ease,” he concluded. Osimhen proved himself as a goalscorer in his last two seasons with both Lille and Sporting Charleroi with 38 goals in 74 matches.
