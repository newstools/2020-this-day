Argentina’s president Alberto Fernandez has advised Lionel Messi to return to his homeland and finish his career at his former youth team club Newell’s Old Boys. Messi,33, shocked the world of football last week by informing Barcelona of his intentions to move on this summer following a turbulent season at the Nou Camp. He has been most strongly linked with a move to Manchester City, where he would link up with his previous manager Pep Guardiola again. And speaking on Argentinean TV channel C5N, Fernandez said: “You are in our hearts and we have never seen you play in our country. “Give us the pleasure of ending your career with Newell’s Old Boys, your club.” And on who he admires between Diego Maradona and Messi Fernandez admitted he admired the 1986 World Cup winner. He stated that his preference for the Napoli icon is due to the fact he graduated from the team he supports, Argentinos Junior. “The great merit of Maradona is that he played alone against the world,” Fernandez added. “I’ve never seen a player like Maradona. “I admire him deeply – more than Messi, to be honest, because he comes from the Argentinos’ youth. He was a kind of gladiator, with incredible strength.” Newell’s fans held a spectacular parade on the streets of Rosario on Thursday in the hope of showing Messi how much it would mean for them for him to move to the club.
