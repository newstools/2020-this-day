By Chuks Okocha The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday said it supported the decision of the United Kingdom to impose visa ban as well as seizure of assets and properties belonging to those involved in undermining the electoral process, particularly ahead of the Edo and Ondo States governorship elections. The party in a statement issued by the National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, said: “Our party commends the UK for its quick response along with the United States in the global efforts to stop the unbridled electoral fraud being perpetrated by leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and their compromised Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and security officials. “With the emerging global action, our party reiterates our call to other countries such as the United Arab Emirates, France, Spain, Canada as well as African countries and the ECOWAS member states to impose similar sanctions on these unscrupulous elements and their family members.” The statement noted that the PDP, being the genuine pan-Nigeria political platform standing with the Nigerian people, urged the global community to profile the election riggers and their agents in INEC and security agencies and ban their family members from benefiting from services from other countries of the world. On the Edo State governorship election, the PDP alleged that among those at the forefront to undermine the democratic process is the APC candidate, Osagie Ize-Iyamu, “who was seen publicly directing thugs, cultists and killers described as tigers and lions to invade polling units and unleash violence on election day, and should be immediately profiled for sanctions.” The party spokesperson said the same goes to the Governor of Ondo State, Rotimi Akeredelo, “who was publicly exposed by a self-confessed APC militant and former APC chairman in the state, Isaac Kekemeke, as being behind the violent attacks against our party in the state.” He said the PDP remains law-abiding, but will never allow anybody to use any mean whatsoever, to manipulate the Edo and Ondo States governorship elections. According to Ologbondiyan, “Never, this will never happen; not after the people of Edo State had manifestly expressed their resolve to re-elect our candidate, Governor Godwin Obaseki, and when the people of Ondo State have resolved to replace the failed Akeredolu with our candidate, Eyitayo Jegede, on September 19 and October 10 respectively.”
