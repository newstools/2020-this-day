My head will explode if I hear any more fake science. President Trump has discussed “Exploding Trees” and when challenged on climate change effects he suggested “I don’t think science knows, actually”. His country is facing a number of explosions, explosions of anger, explosions of violence, and explosions of laughter at his scientific knowledge. It’s ok, I know enough science to know that my head isn’t made of wood, so it won’t explode. Dennis Fitzgerald,
