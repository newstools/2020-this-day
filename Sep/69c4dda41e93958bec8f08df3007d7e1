The Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ile Ife, yesterday, disowned a circular purportedly “issued and signed by the University Registrar” on reopening plans. A statement issued by the Public Relations Officer (PRO) of the university, Abiodun Olarewaju, said the federal government that shut the institution in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic has not reversed the order. The statement was titled ‘OAU yet to resume’. The statement read in part: “The university management wishes to officially inform our students at all levels, their parents and guardians, that the said circular is fake and malicious both in content and context and it should be disregarded in its entirety. “Obafemi Awolowo University is a federal government-owned institution and the instruction to go on recess in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic, in the month of March 2020, by the Federal Government has not been reversed. “Accordingly, we want to use this medium to urge our students to remain calm, and await authentic information from the university management as soon as the federal government gives the go-ahead to reopen the university.”
