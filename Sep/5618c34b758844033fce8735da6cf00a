By Vanessa Obioha MansMark Records has unveiled the third single from the Riddim Doctors project by renowned Nigerian Grammy-winning recording artist and talking drum master, Sikiru Adepoju. Titled ‘Goin’ Somewhere’, the track comes barely a month after Adepoju dropped ‘Take Me Home, Country Roads’ — a vibrant remake of John Denver’s iconic song of the same title. Both singles make up the upcoming nine-track album, ỌPẸ which will be released on September 24 across all digital platforms and Compact Disc outlets. In ‘Goin’ Somewhere’, Adepoju opened the track with his dundun, accompanied by Zakir Hussain’s tablas. Both artistes laid the foundation for Giovanni Hidalgo’s congas to creatively finish in one take, leading to the construction of this living drum-machine taking off unfettered, into the 21st century. Keyboards and steel drum colour this speedy musical vehicle. The final output is a music credit for Adepoju, Hidalgo, Hussain, Femi Ojetunde and Douglas Val Serrant. The new single is available now across all digital music stores including Spotify, Apple Music, iTunes Store, and Amazon Music.
