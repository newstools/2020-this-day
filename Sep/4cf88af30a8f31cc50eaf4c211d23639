By Emmanuel Ugwu Health service providers in Umunneochi Local Government Area of Abia State have expressed alarm over the rising cases of HIV/AIDS in the area. The Chief Matron, Umunneochi General Hospital, Mrs. Jane Ezechinyereugo said that over 50 cases of HIV/AIDS were being recorded on monthly basis at the facility, adding that the situation calls for concern. The nurse, who spoke after taking delivery of drugs and medical consumables donated by Senator Mao Ohuabunwa, noted that there was need to ring the alarm bell in order to arrest the ugly development. She attributed the upsurge in incidents of HIV/AIDS in Umunneochi to the existence of the Lokpanta Cattle Market which breeds prostitution with presence of large number of commercial sex workers. Mrs. Ezechinyereugo therefore appealed to government to take urgent steps to save the situation, which has compounded the health problems in the local government. While lauding Ohuabunwa for donating essential drugs and medical consumables to the General Hospital, the matron noted that it would go a long way in treatment of patients and eliminate out-of- stock syndrome in the hospital. Ohuabunwa, who represented Abia North in the 8th Senate, had made similar donations to other General Hospitals in the component local governments of the senatorial district, including a brand new ambulance donated to Arochukwu General Hospital.
