Relegated Spanish club CD Leganes have turned down several loan offers for Super Eagles defender, Kenneth Omeruo, insisting they would rather sell him on a permanent basis. The experienced central defender still has four years left on his contract at the Madrid club, who paid 5 million Euros last summer to make his loan deal from Chelsea permanent. According to Scorenigeria.com.ng, it was previously believed Leganes will be happy to let Omeruo go on loan so as to free the wage bill of his huge salary. However, it is now understood that Omeruo could play in the Spanish second division in the new season if Leganes did not find an outright buyer for him. That could well impact on his international career after he fought his way back to the first team of the Super Eagles.
