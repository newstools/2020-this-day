I see, in a newspaper, that Facebook is going to block Australia’s news feeds. This is a result of the Australian attempt to make online sites, including Facebook, pay media companies for the content they include in their news feeds. Oh well, I’ll just have to read the reliable newspapers, listen to the mostly reliable radio news or watch the semi reliable tv news. So, no change for me and many others.
