Sylvester Idowu in Warri Operatives of the Nigerian Police Force, B Division in Warri, Delta State, have arrested a 14-year-old suspected internet fraudster locally known as ‘Yahoo boy’. Detectives are also investigating the alleged involvement of the boy’s father in his ‘unholy activities’, according to THISDAY checks. Security sources disclosed that the boy (names withheld) was arrested last week, and preliminary investigations revealed that he had huge funds in an account that did not bear his name. It was learnt that though the boy acknowledged his involvement in internet fraud, his father was arrested and quizzed by detectives when he showed up to secure his bail. “The 14-year-old boy was arrested for internet fraud. His father came to the station to secure his bail when it was discovered that he has been encouraging his son in the illegal business,” the security source disclosed. Police investigation, according to THISDAY findings, revealed that the teenager did not only buy an expensive Sport Utility Vehicle (SUV) for his father, but also uses his account for fund transfers in the illegal business. The source added: “The vehicle the man uses is from the proceeds of the illicit business. You can imagine a household involved in this kind of business.” The Divisional Police Officer (DPO), Benjamin Igomenti, a Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP), was said to have taken over the supervision of the investigation of the case, and that the father might be arrested soon. Igomenti confirmed the incident to THISDAY yesterday, but refused to offer further information, as he referred THISDAY to the Delta State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) for further details.
