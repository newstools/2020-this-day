The Delta State Government has confirmed that academic activities will return to tertiary institutions across the state on October 2, 2020, following months of closure to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Speaking with journalists yesterday, the state Commissioner for Higher Education, Prof. Patrick Muoboghare, explained that students will resume in phases in conformity with the new protocols in respect of the COVID-19 outbreak in the country. The commissioner hinted that the resumption date does not apply to Federal tertiary institutions in the state. But he charged the returning students to comply with COVID-19 protocols in line with the directives of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control. He said, “we have agreed to reopen on October 2nd immediately after the Independence Day celebration. Each institution is to work out its own programme to fall within the time frame given. “This applies to all tertiary institutions under the Delta State Ministry of Higher Education. This doesn’t apply to federal institutions. Federal institutions are not included in this arrangement. They are controlled by the Federal Ministry of Education.” When asked if all students will be allowed to resume at the same time, the commissioner said, “It is very obvious that resumption will be in phases. The schools will work out their own arrangements but within October 2. “At the time this lockdown started, they (tertiary institutions) were not all at the same level. Some were in first semester while others were in second semester. The school management knows what to do. Our appeal is that students should adhere to the COVID-19 protocols”. The Delta State Government and heads of institutions in the state had earlier agreed to tentatively reopen schools on September 21.
