Rebecca Ejifoma Following the results of the successful and peaceful elections in Edo State, the General Overseer of Zionwealth Church Lekki, Chris Omashola, has called for continuous peace among Edo people, as he congratulated the governor-elect, Godwin Obaseki. The pastor, who said this in a media release issued on Sunday, emphasised that when there is peace everyone would enjoy the dividends of democracy and be able to express their franchise again in future elections. While sending his heartfelt messages to residents, Omashola congratulated Obaseki with words of advice. “Congratulations to the governor elect”, as he urged him to use his position to serve the people more than he did during his first term in office. On Sunday September 20, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) declared the PDP candidate Obaseki winner of the election with 307,955 votes against the 223,619 votes of his closest opponent, Osagie Ize-Iyamu of the All Progressive Congress (APC). According to Omashola, he had last month asked Nigerians to describe him as false if the candidate of the PDP lost the election. As published in some national dailies, Omashola had said God is setting Edo State free through the Obaseki. The clergyman, who expressed joy over the Saturday election result, prays for peace for Edo. “Remain peaceful in the outcome of the elections.”
