Chile midfielder Arturo Vidal has joined Inter Milan from Barcelona in a 1m euro (Â£900,000) deal. The signing reunites the 33-year-old with manager Antonio Conte after the pair won three successive Serie A titles together at Juventus. Inter make a belated start to their league campaign on Saturday when they entertain Fiorentina. Vidal had been at Barcelona since 2018, having previously played for Bayern Munich after four years at Juventus.
