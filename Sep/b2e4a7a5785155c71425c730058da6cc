While explaining the key factor in ideation and production of good music videos, Akintunde-Johnson stated that “the most critical factor is the storytelling. The story is the most powerful.” On his part, Adeniji pointed out that for preservation and value of talent and creativity the government has a pivotal role to play in music protection education. “There is a need to enable platforms that will allow access to music through legal means,” he said.
