Negotiations for Anthony Joshua versus Tyson Fury are set to take another significant step, with promoter Eddie Hearn ready to send out a formal contract for the undisputed world title fight. Unified champion Joshua and WBC title holder Fury agreed terms in principle on a two-fight deal in June, with both promotional teams still eager to finalise two blockbuster heavyweight battles in 2021. Joshua’s promoter Hearn has been in regular contact with Top Rank CEO Bob Arum, who guides Fury’s career in America, and there is optimism that further terms can be circulated for discussion.
“Yeah, I’ve been talking to Bob Arum about various things,” Hearn told Sky Sports. “Fury against Joshua is a big ambition of everybody involved, to be honest. “We want to talk about it, but we also want to take care of business, which is Kubrat Pulev for AJ, and Deontay Wilder for Tyson Fury. “I’m very sure you’re going to see two versions of that fight in 2021. I think we’re on the verge now of papering that deal with Bob Arum. We haven’t done it yet, but all the conversations are positive. “We have a lot on our plates with the pandemic, making sure we keep boxing alive and trying to deliver those fights for AJ and Fury, but I think 2021, I’m very sure you’ll see those two fights.” Top Rank president Todd duBoef told Sky Sports this week that a fight between Fury and Joshua for all the major world titles remains a top priority. “There is a gravitation to bring the titles together, and that would be Joshua and Fury,” said DuBoef. “Obviously we would have loved to do that before the end of this year, but for the pandemic. “I don’t think anybody is wavering from that objective.
“Both guys have great personalities, they can fight, and it is overdue. Let’s get it done.”
