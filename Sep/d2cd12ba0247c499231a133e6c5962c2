Full sponsorship granted for nurses; 18 post graduate diploma in nursing education, four degree in nursing, 11 masters degree in nursing and three PhD.” Danja also said that 200 health workers have been granted approval to undertake full time and part-time studies in Nigeria and abroad to build their capacity. He explained that the government has adopted the Primary Healthcare Under One Roof law and converted all its local government health workers to the Primary Healthcare Development Agency (PHDA). He added that the state government also rehabilitated and upgraded eight general hospitals in Dutsin-ma, Katsina, Daura, Funtua, Malumfashi, Kankia, Musawa and Baure Local Government Areas of the state.
