By Omololu Ogunmade The Queen of England, Elizabeth II, Wednesday sent a congratulatory message to President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday’s occasion of Nigeria’s 60th independence anniversary. A statement by Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, said the queen’s message was conveyed by the British High Commission in Nigeria. He quoted the queen as saying, “It gives me great pleasure to offer my warmest congratulations on the 60th anniversary of Nigeria’s Independence, together with my best wishes for your country’s continued happiness and prosperity. “The United Kingdom and Nigeria benefit from strong and enduring ties as Commonwealth partners through shared history and most importantly, our people. These are bonds that I hope and believe will flourish long into the future.” Nigeria secured her independence from British rule on October 1, 1960.
