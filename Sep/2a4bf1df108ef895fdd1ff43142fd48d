Olawale Ajimotokan in Abuja The federal government has inaugurated a 27-man National Humanitarian Co-ordination Technical Working Group (NHCTWG) to provide technical support to the National Humanitarian Coordination Committee (NHCC) constituted by President Muhammadu Buhari to oversee all humanitarian actions in the country. The working group was inaugurated by the Minister of Humanitarian Affair, Disaster Management and Social Development, Sadiya Umar Farouq, and is expected to enhance coordination and seamless delivery of humanitarian aid to affected communities in the country. Farouq charged the members to ensure the implementation of all NHCC recommendations relating to the operationalisation of the CiSEC framework and guidelines and to propose a national vision for humanitarian action. In addition, she said besides the North-east region, the committee should also take into context the country as a whole. “Your terms of reference also include proposal of policies that will enhance coordination and seamless delivery of humanitarian aid to affected communities in the country; ensure that CiSEC guidelines and related action plans reflect adherence to humanitarian principles and best practices while engaging all parties in crisis response situations, taking cognizance of Nigeria’s national security interests,” she said. The minister stressed the need to ensure that functional engagements between security and humanitarian actors remain consistent with the principles under the CiSEC framework and also promote advocacy on humanitarian access, protection and logistics issues as required. The committee headed by Grema Ali is made up of critical stakeholders comprising commissioners in charge of humanitarian issues in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe States; heads of NEMA, NEDC and NCFRMI; representatives of operations of the armed forces, the European Union Commission, United States Agency for International Development and United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
