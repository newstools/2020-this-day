By Omololu Ogunmade President Muhammadu Buhari Monday expressed his sympathy with the victims of the Hadejia floods which destroyed lives and over 100,000 hectares of rice farms in Jigawa State. Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, said Buhari, while reacting to the tragedy, lamented that “this level of destruction as a result of a natural disaster is unprecedented and devastating.” He added: “This destruction to farmlands is particularly worrisome because it comes at a time my government is vigorously pursuing efforts to boost local rice production and end importation of the commodity.” He added, “since agriculture is the largest employer of labour and a major source of income for most ordinary Nigerians, the destruction of rice farms in Jigawa State is bad news not only for the victims, but also for the government policy of achieving food sufficiency and food security in the country.” He assured the victims that federal government would not abandon them.
