I write to bring to your notice the pains and frustrations of the Constituents of Ezza-North/Ishielu Federal Constituency occasioned by the pitiable state of the federal road linking Ezzagu with the other parts of Ebonyi and Enugu States. It is regrettable that the road which is critical to robust rural economy is currently in a deplorable condition. I am particularly worried that added to the general hardship being experienced in the country occasioned by the Coronavirus pandemic, socioeconomic activities of these rural dwellers who are mostly agrarians are grossly undermined. The road is currently inaccessible to road users: commuters, pedestrians, travellers and visitors due to the failed portions. I am concerned about the obvious plight of the helpless school children, traders, worshippers, pregnant women and the sick who are being unreasonably cut-off from schools, markets, churches and medical facilities. I am particularly disturbed that agricultural produce from farms rather than getting to where they are needed unfortunately perish thereby compounding our already bad conditions. The federal road in question passed through the popular AFO Ezzagu Regional Market which used to attract businessmen and women from within and outside Nigeria. The regional market is now a shadow of its former self. I, therefore, call for the completion of the rehabilitation of the 41-kilometre Ozalla-Akpugo-Amagunze-Ihuokpara-Nkomoro Ezzagu federal road. The people of Ezzagu in Ishielu LGA of Ebonyi State also need potable water, electricity, functional health centres, standard schools and markets in the communities. Ezzagu people donâ€™t bury their dead ones during rainy season unless those who die in the village because ambulances and vehicles get trapped on the roads.
