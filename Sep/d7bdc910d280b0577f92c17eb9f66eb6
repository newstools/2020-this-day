Alex Enumah in Abuja Christian singer/songwriter, Sarai Korpacz, is preaching the message of peace and the need for humanity to live in harmony, irrespective of religious and ethnic differences. In her latest and second single of 2020 titled: “Harmony”, the New York-based contemporary Christian artiste, who understands the true power of worship, disclosed that the new album is a direct result of prayers to God concerning the seemingly unending killings taking place in her native Zipak, Kafanchan in Kaduna State. The album “Harmony” apart from being an emotionally charged new song, addresses the need for harmony on a global scale, as well as a call for unity and a plea for God to heal the land. Korpacz, who gave her life to Christ at the early age of six and started writing poems and songs as a teenager, is said to be winning over a growing legion of fans, not just for her beautiful voice and uplifting compositions, but also for not shying away from topics that are quite important to Christian devotees. As a citizen of the United States, Korpacz is aware of the patterns that have led to unrest in the U.S and the world at large and says: “We can all start by praying for our own communities and asking the Lord how to take action. “Harmony is the first song that I produced myself. I was very fortunate to have had an international blend of talented musicians playing the different instruments in the song. “I pray it blesses all those that listen to it and above all leads us all to pray for God to heal the global land.” Korpacz, who experienced chronic pain from a neck injury in 2018, however found the much-needed inspiration in Christian music having found strength to bear the pain when medicine fell short. After a personal spiritual encounter in 2019, she took a circuitous road to performing vocals and to a music career in general.
