John Shiklam in Kaduna Kaduna Electric Distribution Company (KADECO) has commenced the implementation of the new service-based tariff approved by the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC). The company in a statement issued on Wednesday in Kaduna by the Head of Corporate Communication, Abdulazeez Abdullahi, said: “The new tariff regime is not a blanket increase but tied to improved hours of power supply and a more efficient service delivery.” Abdullahi said the company is also working closely with the Meter Asset Providers (MAPs) in its franchise to ensure speedy deployment of meters as directed by the federal government. The statement said: “Under the service-based tariff, feeders from where customers receive power supply to their neighbourhood have been categorised into bands A to E with the tariff increase in descending order. “Customers under band A, who will enjoy a minimum of 20 hours of power supply, are expected to pay N56 per kilowatt hour while customers on band B with minimum 16 hours supply shall pay N54 per kilowatt hour. “Customers on band C, who will enjoy not less than 12 hours of power supply, shall pay N50 per kilowatt hour. “The tariff increase for customers who fall under bands D and E have been frozen until further notice from the regulator.” The statement said further that “customers with prepaid meters shall see the new tariff reflected in their tokens while the new tariff for post-paid customers shall reflect in the next billing cycle.” The company assured customers that “barring circumstances beyond its control, it will do its utmost to ensure compliance with the service levels.” Abdullahi called on customers of the company to endeavour to settle their bills promptly and avoid all forms of energy theft.
