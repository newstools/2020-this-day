Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja The Air Task Force of Operation Lafiya Dole yesterday destroyed hideouts of terrorist group, Boko Haram, killing scores of insurgents at Bula Sabo and Dole in Borno State. This was achieved through air strikes executed to mark the launch of a new subsidiary operation, tagged ‘Hail Storm 2’ an air interdiction operation aimed at taking out identified Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) and BHT targets in the Lake Chad and Sambisa Forest areas of Borno State. A war update issued by the military said the attack at Bula Sabo, on the fringes of the Sambisa Forest, was executed after credible intelligence reports indicated that a group of buildings in the settlement were being used as dwelling places for some Boko Haram commanders. Accordingly, the Air Task Force dispatched Nigerian Air Force (NAF) fighter jets and helicopter gunships, which scored devastating hits on the target buildings including a logistics facility which was seen engulfed in flames. The update signed by the Coordinator of the Defence Media Operations (DDMO), Major General John Enenche, said Dole, which is located in the Yale-Kokiwa axis near Dikwa, was targeted because the settlement was being used by the terrorists as a venue to plan and launch attacks against locations in the surrounding areas. The NAF attack aircraft similarly engaged the location inflicting heavy damage on the insurgents’ structures and neutralising several fighters. Meanwhile, the Nigerian Air Force has announced the commencement of aerial display in preparation for the traditional fly past ceremony to commemorate Nigeria’s 60th Independence anniversary. A NAF statement said the Nigerian Air Force would be conducting an aerial display at the Eagle Square, Abuja on Thursday, 1 October 2020. It said rehearsals for the event, which started yesterday would involve military aircraft flying at low level. It urged members of the public not to panic but go about their normal activities.
