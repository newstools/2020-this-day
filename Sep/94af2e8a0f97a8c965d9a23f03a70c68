The value of trading rose 17.1 per cent to N12.692 billion invested in 1.139 billion at the stock market last week, compared with N10.842 billion staked on 1.226 billion shares the previous week. The increased value came despite a decline of 0.08 per cent in the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) All-Share Index (ASI) to close lower at 25,572.57. Market analysts said trading would remain tepid in the absence of any positive catalyst and have urged investors to remain cautious.
“In the absence of a positive catalyst, and given the still uninspiring macro story, we guide investors to trade cautiously in the short term. However, we expect the market might benefit over the longer term on compelling valuations and as investors seek alpha-yielding opportunities in the face of negative real returns in the fixed income market,” analysts at Cordros Research said. Meanwhile, a breakdown of the trading activity showed that the financial services industry led the 870.300 million shares valued at N7.863 billion traded in 9,427deals.
