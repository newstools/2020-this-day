By John Shiklam The Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) has expressed shock and sadness over the death of the Emir of Zazzau, Alhaji Shehu Idris. In a statement on Sunday in Kaduna, spokesman of the forum, Emmanuel Yawe, said the ACF “received with shock and sadness news of the death of Alhaji Shehu Idris, the Emir of Zauzau at the age of 84.” The forum said the emir was “one of the oldest and highest ranking traditional rulers not only in the north but the whole of Nigeria”. “He was the 18th Emir to rule over the Emirate and in February this year celebrated his 45th year on the throne. “He ruled his Emirate through a period of rapid political, economic, social changes and never lost his focus on his primary responsibility – the maintenance of peace and progress in his Emirate”, the statement said. The ACF condoled with his immediate family, the Zazzau Emirate and the Kaduna state government “over this tragic and untimely loss”. The statement said the ACF will miss his fatherly advice.
