One of the companies in the Zinox Group, TD Africa, is set to host global original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in the technology sector. This will be the first time that global tech giants such as Cisco, Dell EMC, HP, Microsoft, Samsung, Philips, Bosch, Schneider Electric and Zinox, among others, are coming together to establish their respective experience centres under one roof to create a truly immersive and rich experience of latest technologies in action. The tech experience centre is set for launch on October 1, 2020. It is expected to boost Nigeria’s relevance in the global technology race and shore up the country’s march to technology independence. Nigeria will play host to the latest global technologies including those not normally available in Africa, offering all classes of visitors a first-hand experience of new gadgets, solutions and infrastructure that would have previously required a visit abroad, thereby saving corporate organisations, government establishments and individuals money or scarce foreign exchange expended on these trips. The project cited within the Yudala Heights on Idowu Martins Street, Victoria Island, Lagos, will be inaugurated by the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Pantami. Also expected to attend the launch are stakeholders from the technology sector, and other dignitaries, not exceeding 50 in line with the current guidelines on public gatherings occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic. The event will be streamed live to millions of Nigerians via various digital channels. Already, a number of globally-renowned international tech giants, all of whom will be housed within the Tech Experience Centre, will provide real time information, support and expertise to visitors and other prospective customers, eager to be acquainted with the technologies on ground.
