Stuttgart, who have returned to the German Bundesliga for the new season, as well as Belgian club Antwerp have joined the race to sign Taiwo Awoniyi on loan from Liverpool. Scottish champions Celtic have also been linked with the striker. Last season, Awoniyi, 23, played for Mainz 05 in the Bundesliga with impressed officials even hinting on keeping for the new season. Awoniyi has previously played in Belgium with Mouscron as well as KAA Gent. The former Flying Eagles and Golden Eaglets star will most certainly go on another loan deal from the Premier League champions as he is not expected to be granted a work permit in the UK.
