Ayodeji Olowo, popularly known as Cracker Mallo is not a newbie to the new sounds of the Nigerian music industry, having produced for the likes of Olamide, D’Banj, Fireboy DML and TiwaSavage. On creating his own sound and style, Cracker Mallo says he intends to push that further with a debut body of work, an EP dropping this September. Speaking on this he shares, “I am not trying to be so vain but lately, I have been listening to songs from my forthcoming EP titled “ A Friendly Introduction To SAUND” and I can tell you it’s going to be one of the dopest in 2020.” Having produced Fireboy DML’s breakout single “Jealous”, Cracker Mallo has gone on to produce major hits for the likes of Olamide, Tiwa Savage, D’banj and Dice Ailes. His “love for the art and not the money” was one of the major factors which has contributed to his rise onto the big stage as he makes sure every track he works on is dope, a strategy that has worked for him in his journey so far. He sees Sarz, Pharrell Williams and Timbaland as major role models and would love to work with Kanye West as he thinks they’re going to make some insane music together. Cracker Mallo highlights the importance of “Grace”, even in the face of challenges as a music producer as he believes creating music has to do with the mental state. “In times like that, I have to force myself till I catch the vibe, some other time, I’d just sort out myself and get back to the music when all is calm.” he says.
