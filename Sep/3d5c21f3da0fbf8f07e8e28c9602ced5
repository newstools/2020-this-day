By Goddy Egene Equities investors staked N10.842 billion on 1.226 billion shares in 19,529 deals amidst profit taking last week. After a rally, propelled by reactions to corporate earnings and dividend declarations the previous week, profit taking in banking stocks such as Guaranty Trust Bank Plc, United Bank for Africa Plc and Zenith Bank Plc led to a moderation of the growth last week. Consequently, the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) All-Share Index (ASI) went down by 0.05 per cent to close at 25,591.95, while market capitalisation ended the week at N13.351 trillion. However, analysts at Cordros Research urged investors to remain cautious given the prevailing economic situation. “Our view continues to favour cautious trading as risks remain on the horizon due to a combination of the increasing number of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria and weak economic conditions. Thus, we continue to advise investors to seek trading opportunities in only fundamentally justified stocks,” they said. The Financial Services industry regained the number spot on the activity chat with 980.482 million shares valued at N6.987 billion traded in 11,634 deals.
