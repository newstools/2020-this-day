Anthony Joshua still “loves knocking people out” and plans a “demolition job” of Tyson Fury, says Eddie Hearn.
The IBF, WBA and WBO heavyweight champion is expected to defend his belts against mandatory challenger Kubrat Pulev on December 12 in the UK, and has already agreed financial terms to two fights with WBC titleholder Fury next year. “I actually messaged him and I said: ‘You’re going to steamroll through these guys’,” Joshua’s promoter Hearn told Sky Sports.
“He just replied in capitals and said: STEAMROLL!’” Asked if Joshua is plotting to emphatically become the division’s undisputed ruler by stopping Fury, Hearn said: “I think he’d love to. Yeah.
“He knows that Fury is an outstanding fighter and it’s going to be very difficult. But you can ask him for yourself, I believe he has bad intentions in those fights and I believe he expects to. “I believe he will knock out Kubrat Pulev and Tyson Fury.”
Joshua will fight this year with fans in attendance or without, according to Hearn.
