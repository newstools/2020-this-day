Francis Sardauna in Katsina The newly appointed Sharia Court Judges in Katsina State have been urged to be transparent and ensure speedy dispensation of justice in the discharge of their official responsibilities as contained in the provision of the law. The state Chief Judge, Justice Musa Danladi Abubakar, gave the admonition yesterday while swearing in the 20 Sharia court judges in Katsina. He said sanction and severe punishments await any judge found wanting while discharging his obligations, urging them to operate within the code of conduct for judicial officers. Abubakar equally urged them to be conscious of the integrity of the justice system by doing what is right as stipulated by the tenets of Islam. He, however, warned the newly appointed Sharia court judges to desist from inflammatory statements and the use of social media during and after court proceedings. The CJ said: “You must be conscious of your personal integrity and the integrity of the institution by being conscious of who you are now. “You must operate within the code of conduct for judicial officers and other constitutional provisions to enhance professionalism as anyone found wanting will be sanctioned. “We will not tolerate a situation where judges will use the social media against the other person. When a judge behaves in a way that compromises his integrity, he would have committed misconduct.”
