Gareth Bale is closer to leaving Real Madrid now than at any time during his seven years at the Spanish club, according to his agent. Jonathan Barnett told BBC Wales Sport talks over a move back to Tottenham are “slowly progressing”. Spurs boss Jose Mourinho refused to speculate on the talks on Wednesday. Bale, 31, left Spurs to join Real for a then-world record £85m in 2013 and has since scored more than 100 goals and won four Champions League titles. In July 2019, Real Madrid cancelled a deal for Bale to join Chinese Super League club Jiangsu Suning, with the player spending last season at the Bernabeu, playing 20 games. Barnett said on Wednesday: “Gareth is closer to leaving Madrid than at any time in last seven years. “We are still negotiating. We shall see how it goes.” It remains to be seen whether the potential deal will be a loan or a permanent move for Bale. When asked about the Wales captain, Mourinho replied: “He is a Real Madrid player and I don’t comment on players from other clubs. I have to respect that. It’s better not to speak. “I tried to sign him for Real Madrid, which was not possible to do during my time there. But the president followed my instinct and my knowledge and the season I left he brought Gareth to the club. It’s not a secret, even Gareth knows that. “A squad is a puzzle and when a new signing completes the puzzle it’s great for the team. “There are three more weeks, the market is open both ways. I think in football you have to always be waiting for something to happen. Let’s see what happens to us,” added Mourinho, who was in charge of Real Madrid from 2010-2013. The Portuguese previously told Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy that he “needs a striker” before 5 October. Tottenham were beaten 1-0 at home by Everton in their first game of the new Premier League season on Sunday.
