The Special Visitation Panel set up by the federal government to look into the crisis at the University of Lagos (UNILAG) has concluded its investigation and set to submit a report of its findings to the Minister of Education, Mallam Adamu Adamu. A media invitation from the Federal Ministry of Education, by its Director of Press and Public Relations, Ben Bem Goong, said the panel will submit the report to the minister. The government had set up the panel to look into the crisis rocking UNILAG, following the earlier removal of its Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Oluwatoyin Ogundipe, by its governing council. Adamu, who had inaugurated the panel headed by Prof. Tukur Sa’ad, however, warned members against interference with the activities of UNILAG management. He urged “stakeholders in the University of Lagos to fully cooperate with the panel and to allow it to work unhindered.” “I am confident that, as members, you will bring to bear your expertise in university administration in the discharge of this task, in order to bring the institution back to the path of progress and greatness,” he had said. Adamu said, “Councils are to lay down policies while managements are to implement them”, but regretted that, “over the past one year, the ministry has been inundated with complaints and correspondences from the management and the governing council of the University of Lagos as well as the National Assembly, on lingering governance issues in the institution, including allegations of financial infractions and breach of responsibilities.”
