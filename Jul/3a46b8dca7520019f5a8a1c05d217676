*Lille star eyeing move to either Man Utd or Arsenal There appears to be a twist in Napoli’s quests to sign Nigeria and Lille scoring sensation Victor Osimhen as reports have emerged in Italy that the youngster has his eyes elsewhere. According to Football Italia, Osimhen is set to reject Napoli’s mega offer in preference of a move to either Manchester United or Arsenal. The 21 years old Lille forward has been pursued by Gennaro Gattuso’s Napoli for months now. Osimhen met boss Gattuso and was even invited to club President Aurelio De Laurentiis’ home on the island of Capri. On leaving, the striker asked for a few days to think about his next move. But after weeks of being charmed by Napoli, Osimhen is on the verge of knocking them back in order to try to force a move to the Premier League. Napoli had agreed to a £46million fee to sign Osimhen. The Serie A giants, who’ve endured a horror season by their high standards, were also said to have offered him a monster salary. Osimhen has quickly emerged as one of Europe’s top prospects. The eight-cap Nigeria international has scored 18 goals in just 38 games for Lille this season while laying on six assists.
