Nigeria-eligible goalkeepers Prince Adegoke and Kelechi Chibueze are delighted to sign new contracts with Chelsea. The 2003-born players will be first-year scholars at the Stamford Bridge outfit next season and have been promoted to the U18 squad. Adegoke and Chibueze are competing to be Chelsea U18s first-choice goalkeeper for the 2020-2021 campaign and will be observed at close quarters by manager Ed Brand when pre-season preparations begin in the coming weeks. While Chibueze has represented England at U15 and U16 level, Adegoke, who was The Blues U16s number 1 last term, was invited to train with the Nigeria U17 squad in 2019. The Golden Eaglets invitee’s scholarship deal will be automatically upgraded to a professional contract when he turns seventeen in November 2020. In an Instagram post, Chibueze stated : “The journey continues! @chelseafc”. Prince Adegoke said on Instagram : “Proud Day For Me and Family Happy to sign My First Contract at @chelseafc #cfc”. Prince Adegoke’s family including his father, who was a goalkeeper for Victory High School Lagos during his playing days, attended the signing ceremony earlier this week at Cobham.
