By Deji Elumoye The Caretaker\Extraordinary Convention Committee of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has hinted that with the return of the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon Yakubu Dogara, to the party, he will play a key role in reconciling aggrieved party members. A member of the committee, Senator Yusuf Abubakar Yusuf, who made this known to journalists yesterday, said the former speaker would play a very critical role in the party’s quest to reconcile all aggrieved individuals. According to Yusuf, “He is going to be considered as one of the strong members of the party who will play a very critical role in our reconciliation efforts being a very strong member of the House of Representatives.” He described the return of Dogara to the party as a great relief considering his influence as one of the founding fathers of APC. “Dogara took a wrong step in the first place. He was one of the most trusted members of our party. He was misguided to have left the APC at a very wrong time. We are happy that he is back to the house that he built alongside other leaders,” he said On the forthcoming Edo and Ondo States elections, Yusuf expressed optimism that the APC candidates in the two states would win the governorship elections. He said: “We are doing very well. The campaign train in Edo State is going on very well. We are receiving defectors daily. The situation is the same in Ondo State.” “Those who have issues with the governor are being reached out to just to ensure that all areas of disagreements are addressed before the election. “We are doing everything possible to ensure that we address all the challenges we have in the party so that our candidat es would will the elections. That is why we have been doing everything possible to make sure that the party is strong again.”
