By Francis Sardauna The Katsina State Government has begun the training of public office holders in the state on assets declaration and code of conduct in order to enhance transparency and accountability in piloting the affairs of government offices. Governor Aminu Bello Masari, while declaring the two-day workshop open Monday, said the workshop is aimed at acquainting political appointees and public office holders with the code of conduct as enshrined in various sections of the constitution. He reiterated that meaningful development could only be achieved through transparency, decorum, accountability as well as judicious utilisation of public funds by public officer holders. He reminded the participants that the positions they occupied is based on public trust, which must be sustained for delivery of policies and programmes that are aimed at improving the socio- economic well-being of people in the state. He expressed optimism that the participants would be well informed on the objective of assets declaration and the imperative of strict adherence to the code of conduct. According to him, “We sponsored the workshop in line with the policy of transparency and accountability in running of government business by public appointees and career officers. “Successes recorded by the APC administration in critical sectors, which have been sustained despite the current insecurity and financial challenges were due to prudent and judicious utilisation of public resources. “Therefore, without the judicious utilisation of public resources, the state government would have been in the league of states owing worker’s salaries and other entitlements.” Earlier, the Executive Chairman, Code of Conduct Bureau, Prof. Isah Mohammed, said the workshop was organized as part of the functions of the bureau as enshrined in sections 16, 107, 172,173, 209, 292 and 318 of the constitution.
