By Ndubuisi Francis The Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) at the weekend shared a total of N651.184 billion as June allocation among the federal, states, local governments and relevant agencies. This figure is N103.877 million higher than the N547.309 billion shared for May due to higher receipts from taxes and oil revenue. The global benchmark, Brent, has since recovered to about $43 a barrel from a 21-year low below $16 in April. A communiqué released by FAAC after its monthly meeting, which was held via virtual conferencing, put gross statutory revenue available at N524.526 billion. According to the communiqué, the meeting, chaired by the Accountant General of the Federation, Mr. Ahmed Idris, put gross revenue from the Value Added Tax (VAT) at N128.826 billion, while revenue from the Exchange Gain was N42.832 billion.
