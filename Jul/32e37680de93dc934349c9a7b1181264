Omololu Ogunmade in Abuja President Muhammadu Buhari Thursday joined Yoruba socio-cultural and political organisation, Afenifere, to mourn the passing of Pa Ayorinde Fasanmi, describing his death as a big loss to the nation. A statement by Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, said the president condoled with the people and governments of Osun and Ekiti States, family members, friends and associates of the elder statesman. The president recalled that Fasanmi served as a legislator in both the House of Representatives and Senate, and distinguished himself politically by always standing for the truth, especially on issues relating to the uplifting of the downtrodden. Buhari observed that Fasanmi’s wise counsels, which he said were borne out of humility, deep reflection, diligent studies and experience would be sorely missed by governments at different levels. According to him, the deceased regularly and willingly listened to leaders, and always offered good advice on the way forward. The statement added: “As an ardent follower and prodigy of the late sage, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, the President believes the fearless and consistent leader of the Yoruba socio-cultural and political organisation lived to serve his people and the nation, and the progressive ideals that he projected impacted greatly and provided a road map on development at state and federal levels. “President Buhari notes, with commendation, that the efforts of Chief Fasanmi in the founding and sustenance of Nigeria’s democracy will be remembered, and posterity will be glad for his great sacrifices. “The President prays that the Almighty God will receive the soul of the departed leader, and comfort his family.”
