Samuel Kalu has become the second Super Eagles player to test positive for the Covid-19 after Genk striker Paul Onuachu did. Earlier yesterday, it was reported that Kalu is still stranded in Nigeria due to travel ban caused by the pandemic. However, Scorenigeria.com.nglater reported that the winger has been in quarantine at his home in France after he tested positive for Covid-19. This has accounted for his absence at the pre-season camp of Ligue 1 side Bordeaux which started yesterday. The Ligue 1 club had on July 6 announced that one of their players had tested positive for Coronavirus but did not reveal his identity. Kalu, 22, is now expected to rejoin the rest of the squad on July 27 should he turn in a negative test.
