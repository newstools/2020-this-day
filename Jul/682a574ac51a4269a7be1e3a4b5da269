By James Sowole The Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) at the weekend became the first political party to elect its governorship candidate for the October 10, 2020, election. The party, at its primary that was held through indirect mode in Akure, elected Mr. Rotimi Benjamin as its flag bearer for the election. Benjamin, a Master of Business Administration degree holder of the Lagos State University, Ojo, Lagos, was the party’s candidate for the House of Representatives for Ilaje/Eseodo Federal Constituency in March 2019. Benjamin, who is the current Vice President of NUPENG, Lagos Zone, polled 65 votes while his opponent, Dr. Olusegun Osho, polled 20 votes. Not less than 90 delegates, five from each of the 18 Local Government Areas of Ondo State, participated, out of which five were absent. The State Chairman of the ZLP, Dr. Joseph Akinlaja, said the party would continue to improve on the laudable achievements of Dr. Olusegun Mimiko, if its candidate is elected into office. Benjamin, in his acceptance speech, said: “We have a history of being champions of the interest of the masses and have demonstrated in the years that our leader was in office as governor that governance is all about the common man.” The convention was witnessed by a National leader of the ZLP, Dr. Olusegun Mimiko, who was the immediate past governor of the state. Mimiko, who commended members of the party for abiding with COVID19 protocols, called on them to commence person to person campaign using the instrumentalities of social media so as to compensate for the limitations imposed by the observance of the COVID-19 prevention directives.
