Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, has warned the Chairman of the Federal Character Commission (FCC), Dr. Muheeba Dankaka, to stay off politics in all her dealings, describing it as a very “sensitive office.” The Speaker gave the warning yesterday in Abuja when he hosted the chairman of the FCC and her commissioners during a courtesy call in his office. Gbajabiamila said though her being in office could be termed a political appointment, it was imperative for the chairman to be firm and not play politics with her office. He said the office of the chairman and the commission has the “imprimatur of the constitution,” hence her job is constitutional. According to Gbajabiamila, “The reason why I emphasised that you hold a very sensitive office is in the sense that it is one of those offices that have the constitutional imprimatur. You derive your powers from the constitution. It is stated there very clearly. “That’s why it’s important; that’s why it’s sensitive, and it’s also very delicate because it has the potential of determining how unified we are as a country-from the East, West, North and South.” The Speaker stressed that everyone knows what federal character means, adding that in Nigeria today, one of the major issues is how balanced the people are represented. He said: “Even though yours can be considered as a political appointment, you must not play politics with this job. It’s a very important one. It’s one of those commissions that many people don’t realise its significance.”
