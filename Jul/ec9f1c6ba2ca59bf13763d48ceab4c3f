The Nigerian doctors had attempted to board a chartered UK-bound flight number ENT 550 with registration number SP-ES that flew in from London. Immigration said 56 of the doctors had no visa for entry to United Kingdom, while only two had visa. “Medical doctors were refused departure in line with Section 31 subsection 2a and b, on powers conferred on the Comptroller General of Nigeria Immigration Service by the Immigration Act 2015, to prohibit departure of any person under the conditions stated in the Act. “The chartered flight approved for landing in Nigeria was to carry 42 medical doctors for a training program but they were 58 with only two having Visa for entry into UK, a situation that calls for refusal of departure,” Immigration said in a statement signed by its spokesman, Sunday James.
