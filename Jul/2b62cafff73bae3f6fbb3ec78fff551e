For Denzel MOB, 2017 saw the release of his debut album “Denzel’s Comet” which housed a notable collaboration with YCee, one of Africa’s top rappers. Talking about his journey music he shares, ‘ I have always been a fan of literature, writing poems and short stories, right from my junior years in high school. I started out my musical journey through the influence of my elder brother who is also an artist, he brought me into the studio for the first time and I fell in love with the art and the process of making real music.‘ Raised in Lagos with roots from Delta state, he brings a certain peculiar energy that makes his sound so very unique as he comes up with flows that remind you of spoken word. He shares further on his new single and upcoming projects saying , ‘ I just released a single titled “Godzilla”, it’s available on all streaming platforms. I also have 2 EP’s in the works, I’m a new artist so I’m eager to create a niche audience for myself. I make hip hop music, that’s my core but like a lot of talented artists these days I don’t like to be boxed in. I love to experiment with different sounds, R&b, soul and jazz are genres I dabble into every now and then. Nonetheless, if you listen close enough you’ll hear a bit of my rap side in those other sounds. I believe my most unique quality is my flow, my rhyme schemes make my sound different. ‘
