Victor Osimhen’s former agent, Franco Iovino of Star Factory, has suggested that Lille did not want to do transfer business with other clubs interested in signing the Nigeria international except Napoli. The 2015 U17 World Cup-winning striker was linked with a plethora of Premier League clubs, including Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool, following a breakout season that saw him bag 18 goals in all competitions. Iovino has pointed an accusing finger at Lille for complicating negotiations with Napoli after pressurizing Osimhen to change agents, and claimed that the Super Eagle was heading to Italy only because of the relationship between the presidents of the Serie A and Ligue 1 clubs. “It was not clear what happened. Perhaps something fishy went down, probably between the Presidents of Lille and Napoli,” Iovino told Radio Punto Nuovo, according to Football Italia. “The negotiations didn’t slow down because of Star Factory but because the player kept hesitating. William D’Avila is a home agent in Lille. The club will surely have advised Osimhen to leave us and go with him. “They will certainly have promised him money. Lille for some reason wanted to only sell to Napoli, because there’s an excellent relationship between the Presidents. “At the moment, my company doesn’t need to look itself in the mirror, the two clubs do.”
