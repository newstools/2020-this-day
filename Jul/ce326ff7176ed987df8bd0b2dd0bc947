Egbe whose outfit has been receiving accolades for the excellent jobs it is doing across the country and other parts of African continent, noted that Dare has been meticulously planning on how the country can safely return to sports. “I am impressed with the road-map Sunday Dare has drawn up.

I m happy he is putting the health of the athletes first in the whole plan,” observed the stadium facility expert. Egbe stressed that the minister equally deserves thumbs up for making tireless efforts to ensure that the nation’s sporting facilities get better post Covid-19. “We all know that one area we need to work on for our sports to get better is that of infrastructure. “With the plans being put in place by Dare, things would soon be looking up for Nigerian sports. The national stadiums in Abuja and Lagos would soon get a new lease of life going by what the minister is doing and he needs the support of every stakeholder to realize his vision,” Egbe concluded.
