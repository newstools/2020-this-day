Nigeria’s senior national team’s Head Coach, Gernot Rohr, has predicted that the Super Eagles will have a very difficult season in 2022. The three-time African champions will be confident of qualifying for both the 2022 World Cup and the next Africa Cup of Nations, which will take place in the same year after being pushed back on the calendar due to the coronavirus pandemic. With a strenuous qualifying campaign across two tournaments expected for 2021, Rohr fears that the players will be tired come the following year when the tournaments are played. “The Africa Cup of Nations is postponed. It’s the same for everyone so it’s not a drawback,” Rohr told Girondins4ever. “We have more time to prepare as well as for other countries. We can continue the play-offs and start the World Cup qualifiers at the same time. “But it will be a difficult 2022 year because already in 2021, there are a lot of qualifying matches to play for the team. “I think we will have time to play a few friendlies. In the year 2022, if we have qualified for the World Cup and the AFCON, there will be many, many games to play. So it will certainly be a difficult year.” Rohr’s new contract with the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), signed in May and set to run to the end of 2022, includes a mandate to qualify for the next World Cup and win the AFCON.
