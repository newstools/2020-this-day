The House of Representatives Committee on Public Account has given a seven-day ultimatum to the Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Ibok Ekwe Ibas, to appear before the Committee. Lawmakers in the committee expressed their displeasure that the Chief of Naval Staff failed to honour their earlier invitation, and instead sent the Nigerian Navyâ€™s Assistant Director of Budget, whom the lawmakers consider to be too low ranked to address the parliament. They asked the Chief of Naval Staff to ensure that he honours the invitation within seven days. The Naval Chief is expected to respond to a query from the Auditor General of the Federation regarding certain activities within the Nigerian Navy. Recently, the House of Representatives launched various investigations and probes, querying some sectors and agencies within the country. Most recent probes include an investigation into the alleged illegal withdrawals from the dividends accounts of the Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG), as well as a probe of the power sector.
