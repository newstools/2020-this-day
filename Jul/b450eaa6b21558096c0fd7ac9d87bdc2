Medical doctors at the Ondo Infectious Disease Hospital (IDH) under the auspices of the National Association of Government General Medical and Dental Practitioners (NAGGMDP) have stopped attending to patients. The Ondo IDH is where patients that tested positive for infectious disease like lassa fever and coronavirus are treated. State Secretary of NAGGMDP, Dr. Olasakinju Tunde, who announced the doctors’ withdrawal of service in a statement, said it was due to failure of Government to accede to their demands. Among their demands were alleged government failure to conclude negotiations on the erstwhile suspended Minimum Wage and Consequential Adjustments already enjoyed by the Non-Medical Staff Since January 2020, inadequate supply of personal protective equipments (PPE) and the general welfare of our members which include life insurance for frontline doctors. According to the statement: “We had through the congress requested that our members who are the COVID19 specialists in the Infectious Disease Hospital Akure to continue to work till Thursday morning, 2nd July 2020 in the interest of the general public and particularly confirmation of the COVID19 status of Mr. Governor. “It is however imperative that our members be withdrawn immediately (from midnight today 6th July 2020) due to lack of the human face expected from the government. “We are pained to have been made to do as such.”
