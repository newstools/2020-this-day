By Udora Orizu The House of Representatives has expressed sadness over the sudden demise of Nigeria’s first-ever female helicopter combat pilot, Tolulope Arotile. Arotile died on Tuesday as a result of head injuries sustained from a road traffic accident at NAF Base in Kaduna State. The Chairman of the House Committee on Airforce, Hon. Shehu Koko, in a statement issued, described her as a heroine whose contribution in the war against terrorism and other criminal elements in the country cannot be wished away easily. He said, “It is with great sadness that I learned today of flying Officer Tolulope Arotile’s passing. Arotile overcame incredible obstacles to devote her life to service—service to the nation, to the Nigeria Airforce, the women, and indeed all the people of Nigeria.” “Arotile was a warm and devoted young woman and I send my condolences to her family. She worked tirelessly as a fighter pilot. She forged new ground for women in Nigeria helping to reinforce the saying that whatever men can do, women even do better. And, she found her true passion as a pilot , indeed as the first female fighter pilot in the country. She will be sorely missed even though she left her footprints in the sands of time.” ”The Committee chief thereby prayed the Almighty God to grant Arotile’s soul eternal rest. In addition the committee is condolling the immediate family and Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Abubakar Sadique, Air men and Air women of the service.”
