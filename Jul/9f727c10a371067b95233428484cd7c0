Former Nigerian Ambassador to Togo, Vincent Sunny Okobi, is dead. He was aged 82. A statement signed by his son Amaechi Michael Okobi, on behalf of the family, said Ambassador Okobi passed away peacefully surrounded by his family on Saturday, June 27 after a long illness. “Ambassador Okobi was the quintessential gentleman and a diplomat who has left an indelible mark on the world stage. First as a clerk under then Governor-General of Nigeria Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, before leaving Nigeria for the United States. Then as a civil rights activist and President of the African Students’ Union in Washington, D.C. in the 1960s. “While serving as Nigerian Ambassador to Togo, he was awarded the Togolese National Award by President Gnassingbe Eyadema. He was also awarded France’s National Order of Merit by President Jacques Chirac and later the Legion of Honour by President François Mitterrand for his commitment to promoting Franco-Nigerian relations,” the statement said. The statement said Okobi had left his most unforgettable legacy as a devoted husband of 52 years, father of four children and grandfather of 14. Ambassador Okobi, a proud son of Asaba, Delta State, who was conferred with the Olinzele title, Owelle Osowa Ahaba, by His Royal Majesty, Asagba of Asaba, Professor Chike Edozien, was a lifelong, devout Catholic, initiated into the 4th Degree of the Order of The Knights of St. Mulumba. The statement said “in strict adherence to COVID-19 guidelines, we respectfully ask that well wishers do not plan home visits to the family at this time.” It however urged well-wishers to keep the family in prayers, adding that burial plans would be announced shortly.
