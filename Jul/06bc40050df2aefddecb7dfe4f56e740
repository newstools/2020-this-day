Super Eagles’ rave-of-the-moment, Victor Osimhen, has been handed a 10-day ultimatum to decide whether he wants the offer from Napoli or not. The bronze medal winner with Super Eagles at the last 2019 AFCON finals in Egypt has been one of the most sought after striker by big clubs in Europe including Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur, Real Madrid and FC Barcelona. However, only the Serie A Napoli have been able to put money on the table, waiting for Osimhen’s signature to switch from Lille to Naples. Reports by Corriere dello Sport, claimed the Naples outfit want an immediate response from the Nigeria international to avoid a repeat of their failed move for Nicolas Pepe last summer and also have time to find an alternative in the event of Osimhen’s rejection of their bid. Osimhen has been to the Italian city to meet with the club’s chiefs including Head Coach Gennaro Gattuso after his brilliant debut campaign at Lille where he scored 13 goals in 27 Ligue 1 games. The 21-year old forward, who was a product of Ultimate Strikers Academy of Lagos, last season had wanted to move to FC Monaco but the inability of the side to be involve in the ongoing UEFA Champions League made the Nigerian for move to Lille from his parent club FC Charlerio of Belguim. Napoli FC are one foot into the next round of the 2019/20 UEFA Champions League with a return leg fixture against FC Barcelona after 1-1 scoreline in Naples last March. They are however ways behind in the race for the top four of the Italian topflight . They are sixth on the log with a game at hand. It is not yet certain if inability of Napoli to qualify for the Champions League is part of what Osimhen’s representatives are looking at in causing the delay to sign the dotted lines.
