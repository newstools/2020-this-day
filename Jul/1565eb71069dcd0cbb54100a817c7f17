By Chuks Okocha A former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr. Yakubu Dogara, has described as infantile, rash and fatuous the statement issued on behalf of the All Progressives Congress (APC) by Mr. Yekini Nabena, which desperately sought to link him to a suspected cybercriminal, Hushpuppi, on the basis of a group photograph taken at a public event. A statement signed by the Media Aide to the Former Speaker, Mr. Turaki Hassan, said: “Nabena should have known that it is share mindlessness to attempt to execute mischief and blackmail in plain sight before the public some of whom are better informed. Who is that fool that links people to criminal activity simply because they appeared in a group picture at a public event comprising of people from different walks of life? “If appearing in a group photograph is what Nabena is now using to establish a link or connection to crimes or alleged criminals then why didn’t he issue such a statement in the wake of the arrest of a suspected money launderer by name Mr. Ismaila Mustapha (AKA: Mompha) whose pictures with notable personalities including some APC governors are all over the social media? Is Nabena guilty of selective amnesia or share perfidy? Who is Nabena scared of? Who is he trying to fool? “For the records, Hon. Yakubu Dogara has agreed to waive his right to a trial and go to jail if Nabena establishes any form of links or connection between him and the alleged cybercriminal before the event where the picture was taken and after the event until now. For Hon. Yakubu Dogara, that picture was just another picture among the thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of such pictures with Nigerians from all walks of life.” Dogara challenged Nabena to speak on issues affecting the welfare of Nigeria union, adding that there is no honour in speaking about group pictures taken at public events “when the nation is bleeding and m ost Nigerian families are struggling and hurting.”
