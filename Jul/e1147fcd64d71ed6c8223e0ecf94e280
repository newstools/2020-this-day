Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja Strong indications emerged last night that a former Commander of Operation Lafiya Dole, Major General Olusegun Adeniyi, may face court martial. Adeniyi had in March appeared in a video complaining about poor equipment after an attack by terrorists left many soldiers dead. Military authorities were miffed by his outburst but decided to play down the matter for an opportune time. He was later redeployed to the Nigerian Army Resource Center (NARC) in Abuja. Adeniyi had appeared in the video lamenting poor equipment of troops to contain insurgents, and decried loss of men and equipment in a fierce encounter with terrorist group, Boko Haram. He said the insurgents confronted troops from “every flank with not less than 15 gun trucks.” He also pooh-poohed poor intelligence, which contributed to the heavy casualty figure. THISDAY gathered that he is expected to appear before the court-martial, which would commence sitting by July 20 this year. When contacted on phone, Army Spokesperson, Col. Sagir Musa, said “Impossible. How is that possible?” But other military sources confirmed the impending court-martial.
