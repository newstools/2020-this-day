Algeria re-imposed travel restrictions on Friday and increased testing in a bid to stop a rise in novel coronavirus infections. Under the measure, citizens would be barred from traveling to and from 29 provinces including the capital, Algiers, for a week starting from last Friday, Reuters quoted the government to have said in a statement after a meeting chaired by President Abdelmadjid Tebboune to discuss the health situation. The authorities last month eased restrictions and had shortened its curfew. The government also said it would allow all state and private laboratories to conduct COVID-19 tests to help cope with a growing number of patients, the statement said.
