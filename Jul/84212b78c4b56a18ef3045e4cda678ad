Sergio Ramos scored the only goal for a second consecutive game as Real Madrid beat Athletic Bilbao 1-0 to go seven points clear at the top of La Liga. Ramos slammed home a penalty – just as he did on Thursday against Getafe – after Dani Garcia fouled Marcelo in a decision given by VAR. He has scored five goals in seven matches – all wins – since the restart. Defending champions Barcelona visited Villarreal last night looking to bring the gap back to four points. Real Madrid’s win over Athletic Bilbao was a game of few goal-scoring chances, with Thibaut Courtois making only one save. Courtois became the first goalkeeper to keep 17 clean sheets for Real in a single La Liga season since Francisco Buyo in 1994/95. Zinedine Zidane’s side only need to win three of their remaining four games to secure a second La Liga title since 2012.
