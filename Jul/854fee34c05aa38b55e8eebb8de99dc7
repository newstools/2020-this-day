By Ibrahim Shuaibu The Jigawa State Chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), yesterday, declared the composition and inauguration of caretaker committees in the 27 local governments of the state as null and void. The State Caretaker Chairman of PDP, Mr. Umar Mungadi, told reporters at the party secretariat in Dutse, that the inaugurated 135 members of the local government’s caretaker committees have been dissolved. Mungadi said the decision to dissolve the committees followed an earlier petition by a faction of the party, which made the National Working Committee (NWC) of the PDP to rescind the appointments of the caretaker committees. He said that the NWC had called on all our leaders, members and supporters in Jigawa State and the nation at large to disregard the purported caretaker committees as they do not have the mandate and approval of the party at any level. A statement signed by the PDP National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, declared that the NWC hereby directs the North West Zonal Working Committee (NWZWC) of our great party to immediately take charge and supervise the activities of the Jigawa State Caretaker Committee. The NWC urged all members of the party in Jigawa to remain calm and continue to work with the NWZWC as it coordinates the activities of the state’s caretaker committee.
