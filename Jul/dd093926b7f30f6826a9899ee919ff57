By Chinedu Eze The Accident Investigation Bureau (AIB) has released its final report on the helicopter crash involving Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, which occurred at Kabba, Kogi state in February 2019, saying that the accident occurred because the pilot lacked landing technique. The Agusta Westland 139 chopper with registration number 5N-CML owned and operated by Caverton Helicopters Limited crash-landed at Kabba stadium. The chopper had on board Osinbajo and 11 others including the crewmembers. The Vice President was scheduled to flag off the distribution of Traderâ€™s Money to market women in Kogi state. AIB Commissioner/Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Akin Olateru released the report on Tuesday and three others involving Aero Contractors and Ilorin International Aviation College. The Commissioner noted that the helicopter crew initially sighted the football field before losing visual contact with the ground and the external surrounding. According to him, at exactly 1:43 pm, the helicopter experienced a hard landing on the right main landing gear and rolled over. All the occupants were evacuated unhurt. Listing the causal factors, Olateru blamed the incident on misjudgment of distance by the crewmembers, inappropriate landing techniques and non-adherence to the landing process. He also said the helicopter operator failed to conduct risk assessment of the landing preparedness. However, the Commissioner said 11 days after the crash, the bureau issued two interim safety recommendations in its interim report to the Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) and Caverton. The other three reports were two incidents involving Ilorin Aviation College at the Ilorin International Airport and Aero Contractor Port Harcourt- Lagos flight, which experienced smoke on board.
