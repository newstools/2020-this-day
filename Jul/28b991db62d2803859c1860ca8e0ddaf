The Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu has commended Mouka Limited for the donation of 500 mattresses for the equipment of the state’s COVID-19 isolation centres. While receiving the donations recently in Lagos, he said the gesture will help in the fight against the pandemic, adding that the assistance was timely. He said: “Our administration is taking a giant stride in ensuring that the pandemic is contained.” The Chief Executive Officer, Mouka Limited, Raymond Murphy, said the company sees itself as a partner during a crisis and that the wellbeing of Nigerians was at the core of its mission. He mentioned that the donation of mattresses to the isolation centres for COVID-19 relief was aimed at enhancing government’s effort in providing appropriate treatment for infected persons as well as curtailing the pandemic. “Mouka exists to provide comfort to Nigerians and we stay true to our mission even at this period of the COVID-19 pandemic,” he said. In March this year, a donation of another 200 mattresses was made to victims of Abule Ado gas pipeline explosion by the firm.
