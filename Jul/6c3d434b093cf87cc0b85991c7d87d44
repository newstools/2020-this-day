Blame corruption for insecurity in north Northern Coalition Groups (NCG) said they are working towards tackling insecurity in the 19 states of northern Nigeria. The groups also attributed the worsening insecurity in the north to corruption occasion by unemployment. At the state executive/interest groups harmonisation and security assessment meeting held in Makurdi, Benue State capital. The group’s Board of Trustee Chairman, Alhaji Nastura Ashir Sharif, represented by Mohammed Abdulahi Mohammed, noted that they have resolved to tackle insecurity in the north through collective effort . They blame corruption as main reason for the insecurity in the north and reiterated calls for the Service chiefs to be changed so as to give the fight against bandits a new bite and fresh ideas . They said they are going round all states in the north to collate views directly from victims of insecurity so as to find a lasting solution. “After going round the northern states and meeting with stakeholders, we shall take their views on insecurity to the central body of CNG and deliberate over it to find a common ground.” The leaders resolved that very soon the insecurity in the north will be a thing of the past, saying each state had its own security situation just as Benue is about herdsmen and farmers clash, kidnappings and bandits. The one-day meeting of Northern Coalition Groups (CNG) with a theme ‘Harmonisation and security assessment’ was attended by many interest groups across the 23 local government area in Benue State.
