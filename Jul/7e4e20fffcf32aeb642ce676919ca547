Omololu Ogunmade in Abuja. Former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, has again defected to the All Progressives Congress (APC), the party he dumped before the 2019 general election. Following the defection, Dogara met with President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday in the State House, Abuja. This defection marked the second time the embattled ex-speaker would dump the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for APC. He had first dumped PDP ahead of the 2015 general election and joined APC. He dumped the APC again for PDP in 2018 ahead of the 2019 polls. Dogara was led to a meeting with the president on Friday by the Chairman of APC Caretaker/National Planning Committee and Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, who introduced Dogara to Buhari as a returnee to the ruling party. Dogara declined to speak with journalists after the meeting, but Buni confirmed his defection to APC. Details laterâ€¦
