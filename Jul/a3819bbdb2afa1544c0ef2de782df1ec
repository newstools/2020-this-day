By Kemi Olaitan The wrangling between the family of the late former governor of Oyo State, Senator Abiola Ajimobi, and the state government over the handling of the burial of the two-term governor has refused to abate, as a delegation of the state government to the 8th day fidau prayer for the deceased was on Sunday turned back. The delegation, which was led by the Deputy Governor, Mr. Raufu Olaniyan, including Messrs Abiodun Abdul-Raheem and Seun Ashamu, Commissioners for Land and Energy respectively, was turned back from entering the Yemoja Street,  Oluyole Estate, Ibadan residence of the Ajimobis. Since the death of the former governor on June 25, accusations and counter-accusations had trailed the handling of his burial with his wife, Florence, openly accusing the state government of not asking after Ajimobi when he was on sick bed and when he eventually passed on. THISDAY learnt that security details attached to the venue were said to have resisted efforts by the delegation to enter  as they almost engaged in open confrontation with the  security details attached to the deputy governor. It was gathered that Olaniyan thereafter left after making frantic calls to people believed to be close to the family to register his displeasure on the treatment meted out to him and other members of the delegation.
