Nigeria’s Victor Osimhen has finally sealed a deal with Italian side, Napoli. French side, Lille, is expected to announce the departure of the Super Eagles’ striker today. He has signed a five-year deal, which sees him joining the club where the legendary Diego Maradona was a cult hero. A year in the deal signed by Osimhen is put at €70m, which could rise to €80m after a number of performance-related add-ons. “It’s finally done! All documents are signed. Osimhen is a Napoli player. Lille should formalise his departure on Thursday. Italian daily, Tuttomercarto tweeted, “All of the paperwork and contracts have been signed off for Victor Osimhen’s move to Napoli. All that’s left to do now is the announcement.” The deal is the most expensive signing in the history of the club and the highest transfer deal of the summer so far. Osimhen’s deal is €1m more than the African record transfer fee Arsenal paid Lille for Ivory Coast international Nicolas Pepe last summer. The 21-year-old Osimhen, who scored 18 goals in 32 games for Lille, will wear the No.9 jersey at Napoli next season.
