The Emir of Kano, Aminu Ado Bayero, has reappointed deposed Sarkin Dawaki Mai Tuta, Aminu Babba Dan Agundi, into the Kano Emirate Council. In 2003, his late father had deposed Dan Agundi as district head of Gabasawa and Sarkin Dawaki Maituta over alleged insubordination. Dan Agundi had filed legal action to challenge his removal and recently, the Supreme Court affirmed his sack. But the current emir appointed Agundi as the new “Sarkin Dawaki Babba” of Kano. Confirming the reappointment, Special Adviser to Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State, on Chieftaincy Affairs, Tijjani Sanka, said the state government had received a letter from the Emirate Council seeking the reappointment of Agundi. Sanka said the reappointment of Agundi shows the emir is interested in resolving decades of legal tussles in the emirate council. The Emir of Kano has also appointed Sanusi Ado Bayero, his elder brother, as Wamban Kano and a member of the Emirate Council. Sanusi had gone on exile to Abuja after he failed to succeed his late father. A former governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Muhammad Sanusi, had succeeded the late Emir of Kano, but Ganduje deposed Sanusi earlier in the year. The new Wamban Kano has since paid homage to the current emir, signalling his resumption to the Kano emirate.
