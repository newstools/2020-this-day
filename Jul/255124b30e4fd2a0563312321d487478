By James Sowole Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu yesterday asked his supporters to disregard the widely circulated rumours that he has been disqualified by the All Progressives Congress (APC) Primary Election Screening Committee. The committee has reportedly disqualified one of the 12 aspirants jostling for the ticket of the party for the October 10 gubernatorial election in the state. However, the committee has yet to disclose the name of the disqualified aspirants. Akeredolu in a statement signed by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Ojo Oyewamide, said the news that he has been disqualified was untrue. He noted that he has not been disqualified from participating at the party primary scheduled for July 20. The governor described the news as another distraction unleashed with the aim of deceiving the unsuspecting public The statement added: “This is yet another distraction unleashed with the aim of deceiving the unsuspecting public and diverting attention from the self-imposed pains on the part of those behind the story. “It is clearly, coming from those who have chosen the perfidious political path. “Governor Akeredolu is not just participating at the party primary, he shall be re-elected by the grace of God on October 10, 2020.” The governor, therefore, appealed to all his supporters to ignore the rumours and dedicate this period to God for His continuous grace, favour and protection. “It’s a ploy to distract you. They are scavengers, and will stop at nothing to sustain their trade of deceit. Ignore them, remain firm, be dedicated and be prayerful,” the governor said.
