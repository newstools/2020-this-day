Goddy Egene BUA Cement, one of West Africa’s largest cement companies, is set to establish a three million metric tonnes cement plant and 50 megawatts power plant in Guyuk and Lamurde local governments of Adamawa State in the North-eastern region of Nigeria. The Chairman of BUA, Abdul Samad Rabiu, disclosed this when he led the BUA Cement management team on a courtesy call to the Adamawa State Governor, Ahmadu Fintiri in Yola. According to Rabiu, preliminary findings show that the two local governments are reputed to have good quality of limestone deposits, stating that BUA Cement is ready to begin the investment in the state. He added that the BUA will use new technologies to supply power to the proposed cement plant and communities of Guyuk and Lamurde in addition to providing three thousand direct and five thousand indirect jobs. The chairman stressed that the Guyuk Cement Plant will be the major investment in the North East by BUA and solicited for support of Governor Fintiri to set up the factory. Rabiu said the company made a decision to source its raw materials locally and it has invested billions of dollars in various sectors across Nigeria and therefore urged the state government to support BUA to actualise the Guyuk Cement project. Responding, Governor Fintiri said his administration’s effort in exploring local contents has started yielding results and thanked BUA for showing interest in establishing the cement plant in Guyuk. He further assured the management team of BUA that government would make whatever is needed and provide the necessary support which will create enabling environment so that the BUA Cement company in Guyuk will become a reality.
