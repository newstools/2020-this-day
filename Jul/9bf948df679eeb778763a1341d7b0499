Last week, I rightfully referred to the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio, as a clown, following the manner he messed up as a governor, a senator and now, as minister. I guess nobody is still in doubt about this, following his volte-face at the House of Representatives over his earlier allegation that the lawmakers got 60 per cent of the contracts awarded by the Niger Delta Development Commission. This jester, who made the claim on national television, has turned around to deny it, few days after he was told to provide the list of the profiting lawmakers. He went back crawling to the lawmakers, saying he referred to old contracts awarded by the NDDC which had not been paid for, and some of which are part of the constituency projects of the lawmakers. This minister is believed to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of NDDC contracts. So, he was only showboating few days back.
Akpabio’s volte-face is disgusting. Can you imagine this minister denying something that was recorded? This is a remark we all heard clearly. Well, I was not surprised. This is the true character of Akpabio. It tells you how warped he is and can’t be trusted with anything, right from his days as commissioner in Akwa Ibom State. Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila scornfully read Akpabio’s response, which came after he threatened to sue the minister for failing to prove that NDDC awarded contracts to them, and said it would still be referred to the Committee on Ethics and Privileges for scrutiny.
Akpabio has no business remaining a day longer as minister. He is responsible for the bulk of the mess at NDDC in the last nine months. With a man like this, Nigeria will continue to lag behind.
