Uche Nnaike The Coordinator of the Ijaw Monitoring Congress and a former Publicity Secretary of the Ijaw National Congress, Mr. Joseph Evah, has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to return the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) to the Presidency. Evah also demanded that institutions that investigate and probe frauds should be used to probe the NDDC instead of politicians when he appeared as a guest on the Morning Show of the Arise Television, where he reacted to the recent investigation of corruption that involved the acting Managing Director of NDDC, Professor Kemebradikumo Pondei. He recommended that the Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC) should be brought in to probe the NDDC. “We are begging the president to do what is right for us; remove politicians from NDDC, checkmate this drama that is happening for the sake of our children because there is a lot that NDDC can do for our generation and the future generation and the presidency know what is right. “Our youths are not engaged. The major problem of the Niger Delta is our governors. If we have proactive governors our problem is half solved,” Evah said.
