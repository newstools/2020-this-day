Three students of Greensprings School, Lagos have been announced in the ‘Top in the Country’ list of the June 2019 IGCSE exam.
The announcement was made recently by the British Council and Cambridge International, and this makes it the fourth consecutive time that students from the school make the list of the Outstanding Cambridge Learner Awards. Expressing his satisfaction with the announcement, the Deputy Director of Education at the school, Dr. Barney Wilson said: “We are very happy that our students (Jehosheba Tijani, Ayooluwa Ogungbenro and Simisola Olusayo) made it to the list. Jehosheba Tijani and Ayooluwa Ogungbenro were awarded Top in the Country in Literature, while Simisola Olusayo got Top in the Country in History. “Our students have always been on the list since 2016 when the award commenced, and aside from the Top in the Country awards, one of our students, Honour Olatunji, has won Top in the World for Mathematics in the past. We now have a total of 19 students who have won the Outstanding Cambridge Learner Awards in the last four years, and we are proud of them,” he said. The Cambridge IGCSE exam is taken by students from 14 to 16 years old and the exam is administered at the final secondary school year of various international schools in Nigeria. The Outstanding Cambridge Learner Awards is an initiative of the British Council with a primary objective of recognising best-performing students and innovative schools.
