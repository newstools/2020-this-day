Kano State Government has suspended all traditional festivities in the forthcoming Eid-el-Kabir celebration to avoid the spread of COVID-19. The gathering for Hawan Daushe -the paying of visit on the governor by Emirs and massing of Emirs at Shettima House, among other traditional outings by the Emirates have been suspended. The state Commissioner for Information, Mr. Muhammad Garba, told journalists that the decision was part of government’s efforts to consolidate on the successes achieved in the fight against the pandmic. Eid-el-Kabir is the holiest festival in Muslims’ honouring the willingness of Prophet Ibrahim to sacrifice his son, Isma’il as an act of submission to God’s command, before God stopped him in his tracks, informing him his sacrifice had been accepted. Garba said the suspension of the Sallah’s festivities was reached after a deliberation by members of the State Executive Council (SEC). He said the Excos however granted the conduct of Eid-de-Kabir congregational prayers across the state under strict observance of social distancing and other COVID-19 safety orders at praying grounds. He announced that the state government would assist in the provision of safety materials, such as face masks and hand sanitisers. “All the five Emirs in Kano will go to the Eid prayer grounds in their respective domains in vehicles. “There will however, be no gathering at Shettima House, and no gathering for Hawan Daushe, Hawan Nassarawa and other traditional outings in the Emirates. “The exercise will be supervised by government officials in their various domains to ensure worshipers comply with the Covid-19 safety protocols,” Garba said.
