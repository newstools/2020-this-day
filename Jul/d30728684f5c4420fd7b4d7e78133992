By John Shiklam Six people, including a female police officer and her daughter, have been abducted by gunmen who invaded Janruwa area, along Patrick Yakowa way in Kaduna metropolis. Eye witnesses said the incident happened at about 10pm Saturday night. The hoodlums were said to be in large number and were shooting sporadically as they broke into houses. A resident of the community said the bandits raided four houses and abducted six people, adding that the community was helpless as the people could not challenge the bandits who were well armed. According to him, the female police officer, her daughter and four others — two female teenagers and two young men — were abducted during the incident, adding that the bandits broke windows to get to their victims. “They picked most of the victims through the widows. After destroying the windows and removing the burglaries, they ordered their victims out of the house. “There was nothing anybody in the community could do to challenge them because they were armed. “The victims had no option than to follow the attackers politely, as they risked being killed if they don’t obey the bandits. “The only grown up woman among those kidnapped was the police woman. When they attempted to break into her house, she ran out, not knowing that the bandits were many outside. “As she ran out to escape, those waiting outside her house, just picked her. “Her teenage daughter was also taken as she tried to escape,” he said. Kaduna is one of the states in the North-west which is bedevilled with serious security challenges and ethic conflicts. When contacted, Mohammed Jalige, the spokesman of the Kaduna Police Command, promised to get details of the incident from the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) in charge of the area and get back. He was yet to get back at the time of filing this report.
