Duro Ikhazuagbe with agency report Even as Napoli fans are anxiously waiting for the arrival of Nigeria and Lille player, Victor Osimhen, Real Madrid midfielder, Esteban Cambiasso, and Inter Milan legend, Giuseppe Bergomi, have questioned the decision of the Super Eagles forward to switch agent during negotiations with the Naples-based club. Osimhen who visited the Serie A club with his agent in the middle of the negotiation to meet with the club Owner, Aurelio de Laurentiis and Manager Gennaro Gattuso, was reported to have severed relations with his French agent, Jean-Gérard Benoît Czajka, for reasons not too clear. Czajka who is the founder of Matching SporInternationalwas alleged to be negotiated bonuses for himself during contract talks with Napoli. This is believed to have prompted Osimhen to switch to controversial agent William D’Avila, who has close ties with several Super Eagles players. In a chat with Sky Calcio Club broadcast (via Area Napoli), Cambiasso was reported to have said : “If I too have changed as many agents as Victor Osimhen did, complicating a negotiation like the one with Napoli? “Honestly not. I had my father, I trusted him; then my brother managed me. These things, in short , I did not do them. “It is also true, however, that football has changed in some respects over the years,” observed the former Madrid Star. Similarly, Italy’s 1982 World Cup-winning defender, Bergomi added : “I have never behaved this way either. I, however, went to talk to the club alone or, at best, with my mother. “That’s right: once my mother came with me and, seeing that I wanted to raise the requests for engagement, she said to me: ‘Beppe, leave it alone: take what they have offered you, it’s good money.” D’Avila, Osimhen’s new agent handles the affairs of players like; Oghenekaro Etebo, Emmanuel Dennis, Henry Onyekuru and Anderson Esiti.
