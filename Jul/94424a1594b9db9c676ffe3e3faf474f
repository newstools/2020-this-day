Vice President Yemi Osinbajo wednesday met with the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Mr. Timipre Sylva, and the Delta State deputy governor, Kingsley Otuaro. The meeting held inside the Presidential Villa, Abuja, was part of efforts aimed at addressing issues arising from the Niger Delta region. Sylva told State House Correspondents after the meeting that the agitations being witnessed lately in the region are routine matters, which would be addressed to avoid escalation. He said, “It is normal for me to consult with the vice president from time to time; we had some notice of agitation from the Niger Delta. “The vice president, of course, preempted everything by inviting the deputy governor of Delta State so that we can understand exactly what the issues are. “These are routine issues; these are host community issues and when they come up, we have to deal with them early before they fester and become bigger problems. “That is why the vice president invited the deputy governor of Delta State to look at the issues so that we can discuss and resolve them quickly before they become bigger issues.” On his part, Otuaro described the meeting as normal consultations. “There are issues and we have agreed that immediately after Sallah, we will have a platform to sorting out some of these issues,” he said.
