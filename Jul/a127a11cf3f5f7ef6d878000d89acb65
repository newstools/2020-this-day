Benneth Oghifo The Minister of Transportation, Mr. Rotimi Amaechi saturday alleged that he had no interest in any court cases involving the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Rivers State. Amaechi, a former governor of Rivers State, warned that no one should drag his name into any court matter involving the APC in Rivers or anywhere else, noting that he is not involved in any APC court matter. He made this clarification in a statement by his media office in response to claims that he was indirectly involved in a case filed in Port Harcourt, Rivers State against the APC. The statement read, “We are aware of plots by a group attempting to muddle the name of Amaechi by dragging him into an ongoing court case involving the APC in Rivers State. “The group has perfected plans to rubbish Amaechi’s image by falsely claiming that he (Amaechi) plans to influence the outcome of the said court matter. “We want to clearly state that the minister is not in court with anybody or any matter relating to the APC. He is in no way involved in any case whatsoever with the APC in Rivers or any other individual or entity in relation to the party. “The individuals or groups pushing this patently false, ill conceived narrative about the honourable minister are warned to immediately desist from their evil plot. We are not unaware of their sponsors and paymasters. We will shame them publicly in due time if they don’t put a stop to their nefarious, ungodly, treacherous plans. “Let us restate that Amaechi is not a defendant or respondent in any matter in court relating to the APC whether in Rivers State or anywhere else.”
