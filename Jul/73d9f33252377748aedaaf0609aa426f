However, the group was able to endure the challenges, thanks to the well-articulated and diligent implementation of our plans set out last year. Going into the remaining half of the year, we remain assiduously committed to deliver greater returns to our shareholders, by constantly reviewing our strategy in the light of global and domestic happenings, ensuring that we provide value to all our stakeholders from time to time,” Ashade said.
