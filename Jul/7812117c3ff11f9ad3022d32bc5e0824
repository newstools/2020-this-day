By Adedayo Akinwale But in a swift response, the APC has said that the PDP was the founder of corruption in Nigeria, to the extent that evil practices were made official way of life during its “16 wasteful years”. The Deputy National Publicity of the party, Mr. Yekini Nabena, stated this in a statement issued yesterday in Abuja, while assuring all Nigerians that the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari would not condone any form of corrupt practices. He insisted that the administration was committed to fighting corruption as promised. Nabena said, “The former ruling party, PDP does not have what it takes to lament about its alleged corruption practices in the present administration of APC. It is on records that the PDP is the founder of corruption in Nigeria, to the extent that the evil practices were made official way of life during its 16 wasteful years. “In APC’s government nobody is above the law. The fact that the suspended acting chairman of the EFCC, Mr. Ibrahim Magu is being investigated should send a signal to all those who think and have blackmailed the government’s anti-corruption battle. The Presidency has assured that there is no hiding place for any corrupt government official in this administration being led by an incorruptible personality, in person of President Muhammadu Buhari.” Nabena called on Nigerians should ignore the fake lamentations of an unrepentant corrupt PDP. He stressed that the main opposition party was only pained that it was no longer in government, adding that PDP did not have history of caring for the people even when the revenue generations were at the highest levels.
