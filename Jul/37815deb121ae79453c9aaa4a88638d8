By Adedayo Akinwale and Udora Orizu The House of Representatives has given the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio, a 48-hour ultimatum to publish the names of members of the 9th National Assembly who got 60 percent of contracts from the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC). Speaker of the House, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, gave this directive while ruling on a matter of privileges moved by the Minority leader, Ndudi Elumelu, during plenary on Tuesday. The Niger Delta Affairs Minister had on Monday while appearing before the House of Representatives Committee on NDDC, investigating financial malfeasance in the Commission, insisted that 60 per cent of NDDC contracts are gotten by federal legislators. Akpabio said: “Just look at your Chairman, I have records to show that most of the NDDC contracts were given out to the National Assembly Members. The two Chairmen of both Committees can explain to you.” Gbajabiamila said the Minister should not only publish names of the benefiting lawmakers, but the companies and the contracts they have been executing. According to him, ”Akpabio owes it a duty to himself, the House Committee on Niger Delta, the people of Niger Delta and Nigerians to publish the names of lawmakers who got contracts from the NDDC.”
