By Hammed Shittu The Kwara State Governor, Mr. AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, has decried the ongoing spike of reported cases of COVID-19 in the country. This is coming as the state government recorded 15 more COVID-19 cases over the weekend to push up the number of active cases in the state to 138. Four more patients were however discharged after testing negative for the dread virus. The total confirmed cases in the state stands as 284 out of which 146 have been discharged and five deaths recorded AbdulRazaq said at the official donation of two ambulances buses by the BUA Group to the state government in Ilorin that the decision to allow gradual easing of lockdown, reopening of businesses and students return to school does not imply that the pandemic has been defeated. He, however, urged residents in the state and other Nigerians to observe COVID-19 guidelines and protocols. The governor said described the fight against COVID-19 as everybody’s business, which every citizen should take responsibility for its success. He commended the BUA Group for donating the ambulance buses to the state government and acknowledged the company’s earlier donation of N100 million to the state government
