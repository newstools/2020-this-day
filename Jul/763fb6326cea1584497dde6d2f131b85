Senior pastor of Household of God Church, Reverend Christopher Okotie has kicked against the approach of US billionaire, Bill Gates, towards the issue of COVID-19 pandemic. In an 80 – minute video released yesterday on YouTube, the pastor accused Gates of leading a global conspiracy to destabilise the world economy. The pastor claimed that the COVID – 19 was a bizarre project conceived by some powerful elements, supported by key leaders of governments around the world to achieve sinister objectives. Okotie listed these objectives to include a systematic reduction of the world population through the increasing COVID– 19 deaths; enforcement of a global lockdown to ruin the economies of nations and impoverish the people and frustrate true worship of God. He quoted diverse scriptures to support his allegation. Okotie deployed his famous teaching grace to explain how the roles of various key Bible characters like the Lord Jesus Christ, Adam, Eve, Solomon, David, Daniel and an event like Sodom and Gomorrah percolate down to the operations of Satanic forces in this age. The Pastor alleged that the vaccine being developed to check the spread of COVID – 19 is a red herring meant to disguise the real sinister intentions of the purported antidotes for the pandemic, which he said, could ultimately cause death on a mass scale.
