By Deji Elumoye, Chucks Okocha and Udora Orizu Security has been beefed up at the premises of the National Assembly to avoid a breakdown of law and order. The security beef up Thursday morning may not be unconnected with the power tussle between the National Assembly Service Commission (NASC) and the Clerk to the National Assembly, Mohammed Sani-Omolori, over the retirement age of workers of the National Assembly. While the commission, in a statement on Wednesday put the retirement age of the parliamentary workers at 60 or 35 years in service, the Assembly management disagreed in another release saying the retirement age stands at 65 or 40 years in service. THISDAY learnt that operatives of the Department of State Services (DSS) and armed policemen stationed at the two entrances to the Assembly were drafted there to ensure that the workers are protected in the course of going about their duties. The additional security is also meant to ensure that nobody takes the law into his hands in the wake of two contradictory statements emanating from the Assembly Commission and management over the actual retirement age of the parliamentary workers.
