By Goddy Egene The stock market recorded a positive performance last week as the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) All-Share Index (ASI) appreciated 0.58 per cent compared with a decline of 0.08 per cent the previous week. The NSE ASI index rose to close at 24,427.73, while market capitalisation added N73.1 billion to close at N12.743 trillion.
Sentiments remained weak because the market depreciated in four days. However, a one-off gain of 6.5 per cent by Dangote Cement Plc on Thursday lifted the market to the positive territory.
