Kwara State Governor, AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, has invited the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to conduct an independent probe into funds so far received and disbursed to the 16 local government areas between May 2019 and now. A panel of inquiry comprising members from various backgrounds will also be set up to look into the local governments funds, according to a statement issued by the governor’s spokesman, Rafiu Ajakaye. “For the sake of accountability and transparency, the governor is hereby calling in the EFCC to conduct urgent probe into funds so far received as allocations and spent by the 16 local government areas between May 29, 2019, and now,” the statement said. It added: “Separately, the governor will also set up a panel of inquiry to look into the same issues. Members of the panel and its terms of reference would be announced soon. “This probe is borne out of the fact that this administration has not touched a kobo belonging to the local government areas. It has nothing to hide. But for abundance of caution, the governor will be tasking not just the EFCC but also a panel of inquiry with members drawn from various backgrounds to investigate the LGA funds; how they have been spent, and expose any mismanagement or diversion of the funds (if any). “The call became necessary in view of the outrageous claims by some persons that money to the tune of N300million was diverted monthly from LGA accounts. “The administration feels this deserves to be probed and laid to rest because governance is about public trust. “Similarly, the governor appeals to the House of Assembly, which comprises the elected representatives of the people with oversight powers, to hold a public hearing on the said matter.”
