Anthonia Aruya said nine arrests were made during the enforcement exercise of the council which started in the state since June 29, 2020. She said, “A major observed non-compliance is the fact that despite the federal government’s explicit policy direction and the PCN’s guidance to stakeholders on relocation of markets into regulated centres (Coordinated Wholesale Centres), a new drug market was discovered recently set up in this state. The PCN has sealed that market preparatory for evacuation.” According to her, the council had visited 557 premises that comprised 68 pharmacies as well as 489 patent medicine shops. Aruya who represented the PCN Registrar, Pharm.
