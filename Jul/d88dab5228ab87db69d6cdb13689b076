Femi Solaja with agency report With Victor Osimhen’s expected switch to Napoli to be officially confirmed today, there seems to be a little twist in the deal following reports that his unnamed agent has headed to court to sue the Super Eagles forward. The agent, according to sources close to the player and as reported by RAI Sport and CalcioNapoli24, has been sacked by Osimhen on the ground of allegedly trying to negotiate extra bonuses for himself rather than focusing on the best deal for the player. The sacked agent has now threatened to drag Osimhen to court if he did not get his share of the contract, according to Football Italia. The source close to Osimhen also confirmed that it was on account of this under-the-table-deal that the striker initially turned down the Napoli offer last week after he had visited the club in Naples. However, that has since been sorted out with the arrival of a new agent. Radio Punto Nuovo also reported that Osimhen has joined the negotiations on Lille President Gerard Lopez’s yacht off the coast of Sardinia. By all accounts, he could have his medical with Napoli today.
