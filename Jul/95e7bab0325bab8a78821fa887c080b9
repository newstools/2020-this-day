Juventus missed out on the chance to wrap up the Serie A title as they fell 2-1 to a surprise defeat at struggling Udinese. Super Eagles defender, William Troost Ekong, played all 90 minutes as Udinese stepped out of drop zone to 15th spot on 39 points from 35 matches. Juve, who have been Italian champions for exactly 3,000 days, need victory in one of their final three games to win their ninth title in a row. They led through Matthijs de Ligt’s powerful drive. But Ilija Nestorovski headed in an equaliser before Seko Fofana’s brilliant winner in injury time. As Maurizio Sarri’s side pushed for a winner, Fofana ran from the halfway line, beat Alex Sandro for pace before cutting inside De Ligt and slotting the ball under Wojciech Szczesny.
