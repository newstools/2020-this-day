Nigeria and Leicester City midfielder, Wilfred Ndidi who has been touted to be the missing link in Manchester United’s engine room has described the Foxes’ fifth place finish in the just ended English topflight as not a bad one altogether despite missing the ticket to the UEFA Champions League. The Super Eagles enforcer who was adjudged the best tackler in the English Premier League this season took to Twitter to thank Leicester’s loyal fans for sticking with the team through tick and thin. “We are a bit disappointed to finish 5th. “But overall, it was a great season,” Ndidi said on his Twitter handle. Despite hanging on to the Top Four for much of the season disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic, Leicester capitulated on the season’s last to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s Manchester United 2-0 to miss the money spinning Europe’s premier club competition. “I want to first of all thank our fans for being with us even when the stadiums were empty due to the pandemic, it was indeed a season to learn from and grow into next season. Thanks for the support,” said a thankful Ndidi who most pundits have been tipping to be the perfect pair for Harry McGuiire in United’s defensive midfield role. Premier League champions Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Chelsea will represent England in Europe’s elite club competition next season. Aside Leicester, Tottenham Hotspur will also be in the Europa League and could be join by Arsenal if they beat Chelsea in the FA Cup final
