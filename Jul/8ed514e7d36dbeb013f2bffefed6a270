The Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike has approved the total re-grassing and rehabilitation of the main-bowl football pitch and the two training pitches of the Adokiye Amiesimaka Sports Complex. The stadium has hosted several local, continental and international matches in the past, but the main-bowl football pitch had been undulating and thus needed an overhaul. It involves excavation and laying of level planting of FIFA approved natural paspallum grass, provision of motorized mower and lawn mowers, installation of sprinklers, laying of 6 underground pumping machines, plumbing and electrical works, amongst others. The move which is in preparation of the state-owned Rivers United’s CAF Champions League campaign for the 2020/2021 season, among other high profile matches, and being handled by a renowned grass expert with core competence and track record in the provision, management and maintenance of sports facilities, is expected to be delivered towards the end of August. According to the Rivers State Commissioner for Sports, Boma Iyaye, Governor Wike is leaving nothing to chance in ensuring that Rivers United has the best of facilities for the continental campaign. He emphasized that re-grassing and rehabilitation of the football pitches demonstrate the Governor’s commitment to the upgrade of sports centers that has seen his administration overhaul facilities at the Alfred Diete Spiff Sports Complex, Port Harcourt. “I want to assure you that when the job is completed, it would be one of the best in Nigeria. Rivers State is known for excellence and you can be sure that this would be top notch to host any major football match,” he stressed. He called on the contractor to strictly adhere to specifications and delivery period, adding that his Ministry would constantly monitor his performance in line with quality job delivery mantra of Governor Wike’s administration.
