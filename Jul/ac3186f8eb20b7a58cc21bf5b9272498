Omon-Julius Onabu in Asaba Delta State Governor, Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, his wife, Edith, and their daughter have all tested negative to the coronavirus disease, and have been subsequently discharged. The formal discharge of the Okowas came barely 48 hours after the announcement made by the Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Mr. Chiedu Ebie, who was alongside the Information Commissioner, Mr. Charles Aniagwu, admitted into the COVID-19 isolation and treatment centre in Asaba three weeks earlier. The news of the state first family testing negative for the virus was broken yesterday in Asaba in a statement issued by the Chief Press Secretary (CPS) to the governor, Mr. Olisa Ifeajika. Okowa had on July 1, 2020, personally told the world via his Twitter handle that he and his wife had both tested positive for the global pandemic few days after their daughter did, saying they had therefore gone into isolation for the necessary medical treatment. However, the statement by the CPS said the governor thanked God Almighty, Deltans and others for praying for their quick recovery even as he appealed to the people to abide by the directives and regulations from the relevant authorities on COVID-19 in order to check the spread of the virus in the state. “The governor appealed to all residents to obey all instructions and regulations targeted at combating and stemming the transmission of the COVID-19 in the state,” Ifeajika stated.
