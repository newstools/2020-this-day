By Ibrahim Shuaibu The suspected kidnappers have abducted the daughter of the Kano State House of Assembly member representing Danbatta constituency, Murtala Musa Kore. The incident occurred at about 2a.m. yesterday when the kidnappers were said to have stormed the residence of the lawmaker at his sleepy village of Kore in Danbatta Local Government Area of the state. Sources informed THISDAY in Kano that the kidnappers wanted to kidnap the lawmaker but took away his 17-year-old daughter, who is an SS II student. The lawmaker said: “I was in Kano when I received a call from home by 2:35a.m. I learned that kidnappers have abducted my daughter, Juwairiyya. “The abductors invaded my house and tied up my elder brother, Lawal Kore, whom they had mistaken for me. When he told them that I wasn’t home they went inside my family’s quarters to verify his claim. “They told my wives and children that they were there to kidnap me and were not ready to leave empty-handed, therefore, they kidnapped my daughter.” However, the kidnappers are yet to contact him for ransom. Meanwhile, the state police command, has failed to confirm or deny the story. Abdullahi, a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) in the state, also assured journalists the matter would be investigated and the findings would be made available to journalists.
