George Okoh in Makurdi Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State has commended the President of African Development Bank (AfDB), Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, for his exoneration in a corruption probe by an independent review panel. The governor, who made the commendation in Makurdi yesterday, said Adesina’s exoneration from the 16 allegations levelled against him confirms the fact that he has distinguished himself as an honest and transparent administrator who has creditably led AfDB in the past five years. He describes the outcome of the independent panel’s review as attestation of Adesina’s competence to head the bank for another term. Ortom said having worked with Adesina in the Federal Executive Council (FEC) as ministers, he knows that he is a man of probity and enviable reputation, adding that he was optimistic that a review of the report by the group which accused the AfDB president of corruption would be proved wrong. The governor encouraged Adesina to consider the development as an inspiration to offer greater service to the African continent and its partners through the bank. He wished the AfDB president a hitch-free re-election next month and a successful second tenure.
