By George Okoh The COVID-19 pandemic has killed the Vice Chairman of the Benue State Action Committee on COVID-19, who was also the Deputy Vice Chancellor (Academics) of the Benue State University(BSU), Prof. Godwin Achinge. Achinge, it was gathered, died yesterday afternoon at an undisclosed hospital in Jos, Plateau State, due to complications arising from the virus. A member of the Benue State Action committee on COVID-19, who pleaded anonymity, confirmed the death of the professor yesterday by telephone. He said: “Yes, we lost Professor Achinge, the vice chairman of the state action committee on COVID-19 this (yesterday) afternoon.” When journalists spoke to the state Commissioner for Information and member of the state action committee on COVID-19, Mrs. Ngunan Addingi, she said she was yet to confirm the report from the chairman of the committee on COVID-19, who is the state Deputy Governor, Benson Abounu. The state Governor, Samuel Ortom, had last Saturday named Prof. Achinge among the over 30 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 in the state in the last few days. Last week, the vice chancellor of the Benue State University also disclosed that he was infected by the virus.
