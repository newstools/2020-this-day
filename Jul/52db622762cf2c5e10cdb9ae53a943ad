The incident, which occurred at about 10a.m, witnessed sporadic gunshots and pandemonium at the court premises, a development that aided the escape of the inmates brought from Jos prison for trial. A source at the court revealed that the inmates were brought with about four armed escorts of correctional service, adding that the gate was immediately opened and as soon as they entered the court premises the gate was locked. “But in the process of un-handcuffing them, the attackers swooped on the vehicle and began to shoot and aided the escape of six, while the remaining four were apprehended by troop of the Special Task Force, Sector 4 command and taken to Police Divisional Headquarters in Barakin-Ladi”, he explained. The people within the court premises scampered to safety in the midst of the pandemonium, as many were injured in the confusion.
