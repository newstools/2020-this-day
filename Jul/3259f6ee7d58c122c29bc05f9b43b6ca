His folly is finally over. I am talking about the Clerk of the National Assembly, Mohammed Sani-Omolori, who was scheming to serve for 40 years as a civil servant. His 35 years ended in February, but he sat back, claiming the 8th Senate amended the terms of service for civil servants in the National Assembly to allow them to do 40 years. With millions of people jobless, this man and 148 others spent months scheming to do 40 years in the civil service. Wonders will never end in Nigeria.
Even when the Head of Service of the Federation, Folasade Yemi-Esan, asked him to go, Sani-Omolori rebuffed her. Yemi-Esan had clearly explained that the extension of service of the Clerk of the National Assembly was illegal and urged the leadership of the National Assembly to reverse it. She stated: “The 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended) classifies the clerk and other staff of the National Assembly as public servants whose conditions of service are guided by the public service rules which derives its existence from Section 169 made pursuant to Section 160(1) of the Constitution.
“In specific terms, Section 318(1) of the Constitution states that ‘public service of the Federation means the service of any capacity in respect of the Government of the Federation and includes as (a) clerk or other staff of the National Assembly or of each house of the National Assembly. The public service rules prescribe attainment of 60 years of age or 35 years of service for an officer to retire, whichever comes earlier.”
Yemi-Esan’s memo was clear enough, but Sani-Omolori scorned it and even battled the National Assembly Service Commission (NASC). He went further to give contrary orders to other disengaged staff of the National Assembly that had clocked 35 years. Thanks to the insistence of the Chairman, NASC, Ahmed Amshi and Yemi-Esan, the desperate Sani-Omolori was eventually pushed out.
