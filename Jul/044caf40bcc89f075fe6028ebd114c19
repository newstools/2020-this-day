Armed security men had beefed up security at the Ondo State House of Assembly complex Tuesday, heightening suspicion that the process for the removal from office of the Deputy Governor, Mr Agboola Ajayi, may commence today. About ten police and Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) patrol vehicles were stationed at the gate of the assembly. Stern looking security personnel manning the gate turned visitors back from entering the assembly. Journalists were directed to call the Chairman of the House Committee on information, Hon. Gbenga Omole, for permission for them to gain access into the complex. Only legislators and workers in the complex were allowed into the premises. The embattled deputy governor has approached the Federal High Court, Abuja seeking injunction to stop the lawmakers from impeaching him.
