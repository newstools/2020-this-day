The 2015 FIFA Under-17 World Cup winner in Chile along with his management team were in Naples last week to meet Napoli chiefs and manager, Gennaro Gattuso. But shortly after the visit, speculations were rife in Italian and British tabloids that Osimhen was not interested in Napoli but transfer to a big English club like Arsenal of Manchester United.

He has been Gattuso’s No 1 choice to replace Poland star Milik, who is set to quit Napoli in this transfer window. Gattuso only took over the Naples team in December 2019 from Carlo Ancelotti. On Monday, Napoli President, Aurelio de Laurentiis, assured Gattuso will keep his post for next season even though the club will not qualify for UEFA Champions League from Serie A this season. A formal announcement of the transfer is now due on Thursday.
