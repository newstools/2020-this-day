By Okon Bassey The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Akwa Ibom State chapter, yesterday elected a new state Chairman, Mr. Udo Ekpenyong, from Ikot Ekpene senatorial district and 38 others to pilot the affairs of the party for the next four years. The election, which had 3,845 delegates, was done through consensus arrangement across the 39 offices. Ekpenyong was a Political Adviser to former state Governor, Obong Victor Attah, and until his election, he was the state Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs. Addressing the delegates, the state Governor, Udom Emmanuel, said the party is challenged to do more for the growth of the state despite its numerous achievements, and commended the efforts of the outgoing state Exco in repositioning the party and enthroning peace in the affairs of the party. Emmanuel maintained that God has always given the PDP direction and victory in all elections it had contested, even as the PDP in the state remained a model of party politics and political democracy in the country. The governor urged the new chairman to maintain the democratic tradition of the party and remain close to God and be faithful to the ideals of the party. In his acceptance speech, Ekpenyong, who attributed his election to God, promised to be focused and determined in order to consolidate on the gains made as well as take the party to greater heights. The new chairman also lauded the outgoing state Exco for ‘laying a good foundation for the new state executive council of the party’, and promised political inclusion and consultation to give the party a human face, even as he solicited for loyalty from party members. In his valedictory speech, the outgoing Chairman, Paul Ekpo, lauded the cooperation of party faithful, saying his tenure witnessed the institutionalisation of internal democracy within the party, and repositioned the party as an instrument for attaining electoral victories.
