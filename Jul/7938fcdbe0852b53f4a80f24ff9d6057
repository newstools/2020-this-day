Commenting on the result, the Managing Director/CEO, Unity Bank Plc, Mrs. Tomi Somefun said: “Despite the inclement economic conditions occasioned by the global pandemic which almost paused or at best put activities at a slower pace in virtually all sectors of the economy, the bank has been able to ride the waves to maintain its growth trajectory looking at the key performance indicators. “The assessment, therefore, is that the repositioning efforts which have taken root before the headwinds are equally able to withstand shocks.” She further attributed the growing health and strength of the bank’s balance sheet to the fact that it has remained focused on its niche market, which is agribusiness.
