By Deji Elumoye The President of the Senate, Dr Ahmad Lawan, has described the late veteran journalist and businessman, Mallam Isma’ila Isa Funtua, as a man of many parts who brought to bear his great intelligence, energy and integrity on everything he did. Lawan, in a condolence message on Tuesday, said the late Funtua was a pioneer and trail blazer who established an authoritative national newspaper and a giant construction company through both of which he has left indelible footprints on the physical and sociology-political landscapes of Nigeria. Describing as a painful loss the death of Funtua on Monday, the Senate President expressed his heartfelt condolences to the family of the late business mogul, community leader, social and political activist and nationalist. “The news of the death of Mallam Isa Funtua left me with profound sadness. He was a man who touched many lives and impacted the development of Nigeria with his foresight, industry, enterprise, boundless enthusiasm, magnetism, friendliness and accommodating spirit. “Mallam Isa Funtua made friends across tribe, religion, generation and class in Nigeria, and touched many lives in public service as well as in his private life,” Lawan said. The Senate President commiserated with the Government and People of Katsina State over the loss. Lawan also particularly condoled with President Muhammadu Buhari, who has lost a close friend, trusted ally and in-law and prayed Allah to comfort the loved ones that Funtua left behind, forgive his sins and accept his soul in Aljannat Firdaus.
