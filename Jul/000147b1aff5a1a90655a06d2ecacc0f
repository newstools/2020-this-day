The Presidential mask has finally appeared – he doesn’t look like the Lone Ranger! The use of the Presidential seal on the side of the mask is amusing, if not inappropriate given what the seal symbolises. We already knew it was him and it would take a much bigger mask to cause any doubt and also a hat to hide the remaining presidential hair. It’s about time he wore a mask as unfortunately some people listen to him rather than to medical experts such as Dr. Anthony Fauci. Leadership does require some sacrifices but wearing a mask is not one of them. Let’s see him hidden behind a mask for the moment before he is hopefully hidden from view by the 2020 electoral results.
