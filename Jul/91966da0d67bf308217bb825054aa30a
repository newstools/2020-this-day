Fadekemi Ajakaiye The Lagos Waste Management Authority (LAWMA) has called on residents to dispose their domestic wastes properly during and after the forth-coming Eid-el-Kabir celebrations. The Authority, in a statement, disclosed that adequate measures had been put in place to ensure that the celebration was observed in a filth-free environment, as waste evacuators have been mandated to work round the clock to clean up the city. The statement noted LAWMA’s resolve to stamp out all forms of improper waste disposal in the metropolis, which has resulted in environmental degradation, calling on residents to patronise only their assigned PSP operators and shun cart pushers. The statement further urged residents to observe the festivities with moderation and piety in line with the spiritual injunctions of the season. Accordingly, the Acting Managing Director of LAWMA, Mr. Ibrahim Odumboni advised residents to desist from dumping wastes indiscriminately on road medians and verges, but to patronise accredited PSP operators in their areas. LAWMA also assured that extra trucks had been deployed to ensure adequate back-up for the PSP operators, urging residents to call the Authority’s toll free lines 07080601020 or 617, to request for prompt attention. While wishing residents happy celebrations, it appealed to Lagosians to shun acts capable of negatively impacting on the environment, stressing that the task of achieving the desired cleaner and healthier environment is a collective responsibility.
