By Eromosele Abiodun Terminal operators operating at the nation’s seaports are beginning to feel the effect of the Covid-19 on their operations as one of them, Josepdam Ports Services (JPS) has allegedly sacked five of its senior staff members. Josepdam Terminal is the operator of terminal A at the Tincan Island Ports Complex. It also operates three berths totaling 484 meters in length. Josepdam also serves as a multipurpose terminal and her business activities include cargo discharge and handling, Ports Management and warehousing.
Sources disclosed that those affected were three managers and two senior executives. According to a reliable source, those affected were the company’s commercial manager; human resource manager; senior accountant; business development manager and audit manager. The source added: “13 other junior staff members were sacked on the 15th of June but reinstated by the intervention of the President- General of the Maritime Workers Union of Nigeria, Com. Adewale Adeyanju. We are not sure of the cause of the sack while some called it restructuring, others said it’s due to Covid-19, but all is not well in Josepdam anymore.” Effort to get the reaction of the terminal operator proved abortive as test messages sent to the managing director, Simon Travers, were not responded as at the time of going to press.
