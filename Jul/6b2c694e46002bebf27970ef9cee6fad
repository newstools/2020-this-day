By Charles Ajunwa With federal government easing lockdown on interstate movement, Cross River State Governor, Sir Ben Ayade, has urged all residents of the state to strictly adhere to the safety protocols from Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) in the fight against Coronavirus pandemic. Ayade in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Christian Ita, said given the influx of people into the state now that the borders are open, it will be impossible for the state to remain free of the virus. While thanking them for voluntary observance of preventive measures reeled out in the last couple of months, he urged them to be more vigilant now than ever before in order to protect themselves from the deadly virus. “Now that our state borders are open, this is the time to be more vigilant. We need to be more careful because we expect the state to start recording Coronavirus cases.” According to him, the “easing of restrictions and the opening of borders and airports, it is actually time for us to be more proactive and adhere strictly to safety protocols.” The governor, however, assured that the state government will work harder to keep the state as safe as possible. “We will intensify our no mask no movement policy and other policies meant to keep our people safe. It is time for us to increase our vigilance. As a state, we will never go to sleep. Government will stay awake so that our people can sleep in peace,” Ayade said.
