By Omon-Julius Onabu The Secretary to the Delta State Government, Mr. Chiedu Ebie, was yesterday discharged from the COVID-19 isolation and management centre in Asaba, following his full recovery from the virus. The SSG and the state Information Commissioner, Charles Aniagwu, were on June 21 admitted into the coronavirus isolation and treatment centre after reportedly testing positive for the virus, but Aniagwu was eventually discharged on July 6, 2020, after recovering and testing negative to the disease. According to a statement issued yesterday by the Chief Press Secretary (CPS) to the governor, Mr Olisa Ifeajika, the SSG was discharged yesterday from the isolation centre having been medically certified as COVID-19 negative. Ifeajika said the SSG discharge brought the number of discharged cases of the virus so far in the state to 583. As at July 12, 2020, Delta State had recorded 1,359 confirmed cases of the pandemic, with 745 of them active, while 31 persons had died of the disease, he noted. Ifeajika, however, quoted Ebie as thanking the people of the state and other Nigerians for the fervent prayers for him and other patients of the COVID-19, including the state Governor, Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, and his family who had also been infected with the virus. While reiterating the state government commitment to combating the pandemic, the CPS urged the people to eschew prejudices and indiscipline in the fight against the virus. “The vices of prejudice and indiscipline are militating against compliance with the COVID-19 protocols in the state,” he lamented, adding that: “Adherence to the directive on the protocols would greatly minimise the spread of the virus in the state.”
