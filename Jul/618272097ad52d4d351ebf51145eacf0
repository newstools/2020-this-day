The British High Commission in Nigeria yesterday said visa applications centres in the country would open from July 28 for Nigerians willing to travel to the United Kingdom to process their papers. The commission noted that Nigerians hoping to visit the UK could do so once international flights resume. The federal government had in March shut the country’s airspace to domestic and international flights as part of measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. However, with the resumption of domestic flights two weeks ago, Nigerians are in high spirits, expecting the government to okay the restart of international flights. The British High Commission in Abuja had in a statement said visa application centres which were initially suspended due to the pandemic would reopen “when it is safe to do”. “We know there are many Nigerian nationals hoping to travel to the UK when flights resume, both for employment and to see family members. “UKVI are working closely with TSL contact, our commercial partner, to reopen visa application centres that were suspended due to COVID-19,” it had said. But while giving an update on Monday, the Commission wrote via Twitter, “Update on visas. Thank you to everyone for your questions and patience. But remember application centres open from 28 July.”
