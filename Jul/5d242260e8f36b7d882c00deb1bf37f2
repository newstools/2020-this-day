By Adedayo Akinwale The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) caucus in the House of Representatives has said that unpleasant government policies contributed to the increasing brazen corruption and insecurity in the country. The Leader of the PDP Caucus, Hon. Kingsley Chinda, in a statement Friday, therefore urged Muslims to use this year’s Eid-el-Kabir to pray for sober reflection and the peaceful coexistence of Nigerians. He said: “Particularly in view of the numerous manmade challenges facing us as a people to include the several killings, kidnappings and general state of insecurity across the county. “Moreso, coupled with brazen and bold face corruption promoted by an inept and unsustainble public polices and programmes; divisive tendencies occasioned by invidious governmental policies and actions, prayers are needed. “Equally of concern to us is the need for everyone to stay safe and help stop the spread of the dreaded coronavirus which is a global pandemic ravaging several countries of the world.” While rejoicing with the Muslim brethren, Chinda also urged them to use this occasion to continue to exhibit the spirit of tolerance, sacrifice, mutual love and peaceful coexistence with others.
