The fate of the Acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Mr. Ibrahim Magu, is hanging in the balance. Magu is currently facing a Presidential Investigative Panel over allegations leveled against him in a memo by the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami. The Presidential Panel comprising representatives of several security agencies is chaired by a former President of the Court of Appeal, retired Justice Ayo Salami. The EFCC boss , who is currently facing the Presidential panel at the State House Abuja, first appeared before the panel on Monday for several hours during which he responded to questions on the alleged infractions which he was accused of by the AGF. The media has been awash with reports quoting unnamed sources that the EFCC boss has been suspended from office by the President, though no official statement has been issued. THISDAY could not confirm the reports. It is not unlikely that some of the reports may have been inspired by the belief that when a public servant is facing a major investigation, he may be required to proceed on suspension so as not to tamper with the investigation or be distracted. Magu has been serving as the anti-graft agency boss in acting capacity since 2015, following the rejection of his nomination by the Senate on two occasions based on unfavourable reports from the Department of State Services. Since the rejection of his nomination by the last senate, President Muhammadu Buhari has not resent is name to the Senate for confirmation. With the ongoing investigation by a presidential panel, the fate of the EFCC boss now hangs in the balance.
