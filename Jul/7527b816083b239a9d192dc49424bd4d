That is why we are introducing this most affordable uniform voice call rate of 11k/sec for all local calls and select international destinations.” Onafowokan added that the MoreLife Complete package underlines 9mobile’s desire to continue to offer meaningful and affordable services to its subscribers.” He disclosed that subscribers could activate the MoreLife Complete package by dialling *620*1# and get the super 11GB data offer by dialling *230*1#.
