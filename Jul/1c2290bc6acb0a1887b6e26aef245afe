By Udora Orizu The Acting Managing Director of Interim Management Committee (IMC) of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) Prof, Kemebradikumo Pondei, and his team on Thursday walked out on the House of Representatives Committee on NDDC. The House Committee on NDDC is probing the alleged mismanagement and illegal spending by the commission. Pondei had objected to Chairman of the Committee, Olubunmi Tunji-Ojo, presiding over the investigative hearing, insisting he cannot preside over a matter in which he is an accused. Members of the Committee, including Benjamin Kalu, Ben Ibakpa and Shehu Koko, told the Acting MD that since there was no document before them, he was constitutionally bound to answer their queries. Members of the IMC stood up and walked out of the venue, while members were still making contributions on the issue. The committee thereby issued a warrant of arrest against the NDDC management, and also passed a vote of confidence on its chairman. Details laterâ€¦.
