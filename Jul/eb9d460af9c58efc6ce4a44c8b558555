By Deji Elumoye The Senate will on July 8, 2020, honour its late member, Senator Bayo Osinowo, with a valedictory service. Already, the leadership of the Senate has formally invited the immediate family of the deceased and Lagos State Government to the session scheduled for 11 a.m. at the Senate chambers. Sources told THISDAY at the weekend that the Senate Leader, Yahaya Abdullahi, last Friday led a seven-man team not only to commiserate with the wife and children of the late senator at his Lagos home, but to also inform and invite them to the valedictory session next Wednesday. The Senate delegation was also at the Marina, the residence of the state Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, to commiserate with the state government over the death of the Lagos East senator as well as to also invite the state government to be part of the valedictory session. The last port of call of the team was the Bourdillion, Ikoyi residence of former state Governor of Lagos State, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, where the team leader, Senator Abdullahi, took time to pray for the repose of the soul of Osinowo, a known member of the inner caucus of Tinubu until his death. Other members of the delegation were Senate Deputy Leader, Robert Boroffice; Senators Tolu Odebiyi, Opeyemi Bamidele, Ibrahim Oloriegbe, Sandy Onor and Olamilekan Adeola. The upper legislative chamber had last Wednesday postponed the valedictory service for Osinowo, due to the absence of his family members, friends and associates. Chairman of the Senate Committee on Media and Publicity, Senator Ajibola Basiru, had said the valedictory session for Osinowo, who died in Lagos on June 15, could not hold as scheduled on Wednesday because the family members were held up in Lagosdue to COVID-19-induced lockdown.
