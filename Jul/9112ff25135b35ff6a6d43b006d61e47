Emma Okonji MTN Nigeria, wednesday launched a new initiative that would enable it begin the trial of e-SIM services on its network, based on approvals received from the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), the telecoms industry regulator. Announcing the launch during a virtual meeting yesterday, the telecoms company said “the launch is in line with its continued drive to lead digital transformation, foster inclusion, improve customer experience and maintain the highest quality of service for its customers”. The e-SIMs, which are different from the physical SIM cards, is the next step in the evolution of Subscriber Identification Modules (SIM) cards. The e-SIMs are designed to deliver unprecedented freedom and flexibility. Unlike the physical SIMs, e-SIMs are built into smartphones, devices and wearables. They support multiple profiles and allow customers to connect multiple numbers to their e-SIM devices. Notwithstanding the sophistication of e-SIMs, MTN said the onboarding requirements would remain the same as are required for a physical SIM, adding that SIM registration, in line with existing regulatory prescriptions, remains a requirement for activating a device embedded with an e-SIM. e-SIMs are particularly useful for people who want to manage personal and business lines easily and effectively or want a separate profile for data. The new technology will also be extremely convenient for frequent travelers and tourists, making it easier for them to opt for and keep a local subscription when visiting Nigeria. The trial which kicked-off yesterday, will run for one year and is open on a ‘first-come first-served’ basis to a limited number of subscribers who own compatible devices. Expressing satisfaction at the development, Chief Operating Officer, MTN Nigeria, Mazen Mroue, said the company was eager to get through the trial process so that the technology could be deployed for the benefit of every Nigerian.
