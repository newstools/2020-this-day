The pioneering meeting is intended to explore the role Islamic finance can play in addressing the $2.5 trillion SDGs funding gap as part of the post-Covid-19 economic recovery. Stakeholders had also discussed the need for the Islamic finance sector to move from talk to collective action to support the achievement of the global goals by 2030. Islamic Development Bank President Bandar Hajjar also welcomed the initiative and called for greater cooperation between the public and private sectors and to use the SDGs to inspire financial innovation.
