Everton could be tempted to include Alex Iwobi as part of a swap deal for Crystal Palace talisman Wilfried Zaha this summer, according to the UK’s The Sun. The Ivory Coast international was valued at £100 million last year.12 months, but is now expected to cost Everton £70 million. Zaha is apparently concerned that he will be priced out of a move away from Selhurst Park with his many suitors, including Everton and Tottenham, operating on a reduced budget. But, as the Sun points out, Everton have drawn up a plan as they look to finally lure a long-time target to Goodison Park; while simultaneously getting an overpriced, under-performing player out of the door. Iwobi has often performed like a £4 million forward, rather than a £40million one, since completing that mega-money move from Arsenal on the final day of the 2019 summer transfer window. Following a series of anonymous performances since the Premier League restart, the report claims that Everton could offer Iwobi as part of a player-plus-cash deal which would see Zaha go in the other direction.
