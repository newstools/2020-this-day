Ugo Aliogo The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) is set to partner celebrities in the entertainment industry such as MI Abaga, Alex Ekubo, Osas Igodaro, Lillian Esoro, Jeff Bankz and others to raise more awareness on corruption by organising #NoCorruptionDay event which is geared towards tackling corruption through mindset reorientation. In a statement issued to THISDAY by the group, in 2019, SERAP undertook a survey to assess key behavioural and belief patterns about corruption across Nigeria. The survey birthed the anti-corruption social norms report. The statement further stated that the report found that 40% of respondents do not believe in the possibility of successfully ending corruption in the country, adding that 43.3 % do not believe they have a role to play in the change dings lend credence to the idea that corruption has become a Nigerian norm. According to the statement: “71% of research respondents were found to depend on the internet and Social media to reset social norms and get information so naturally, these media became the avenues to prioritize to help policy makers and Anti-corruption agencies effectively reach Nigerians. “Marking #NOCORRUPTIONDAY on the July, 17, would be the final lap of a sensitization journey. The journey that will begin about 10 days before will involve a quiz that highlights the role individuals play in perpetuating corruption, a tick-off list of corrupt practices we may unconsciously engage in daily & a breakdown of relevant aspects of the report that could reshape the thinking of the average Nigerian. “The 24-hour #NoCorruptionDay challenge encourages people to commit to avoiding at least five corrupt things they normally do and as such attempt to alter the corruption narrative across board.”
