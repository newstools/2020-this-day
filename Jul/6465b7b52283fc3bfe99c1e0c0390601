By Sunday Ehigiator The Founder and CEO of the popular motorcycle company, ‘GoKada’ and co-founder of ride-sharing venture ‘Pathao’, Fahim Saleh, has been found dead in his New York apartment, with his body dismembered. According to New York Daily News, Wednesday, the New York Police Department (NYPD) officers found the dismembered body of the deceased in a building on Houston, Suffolk Street on the Lower Eastside at about 3:30pm on Tuesday. The officers said they went there after the deceased’s sister called 911 because she had not seen her brother in a day. The Officers also said the limbless, headless torso of the 33-year-old was found with an electric saw lying next to the remains. Pathao Co-founder, Hussain Elius, reacting to Saleh’s gruesome murder, said they were shocked to hear of his demise. ”We are shocked and saddened to hear the reports of the death of Fahim Saleh, one of the founding members of the Pathao team. “Saleh believed in the potential for technology to transform lives in Bangladesh and beyond. “He saw the promise in us when all we had was a common purpose and a shared vision. “He was, and will forever remain, an incredible inspiration for Pathao and our entire ecosystem,” he said. Saleh started Gokada, an on-demand transportation company or motorbike hailing service headquartered in Lagos, Nigeria, which faced setbacks and mass layoffs after Lagos banned commercial motorcycles (Okada) from operating, in January 2020. He also co-founded Pathao together with Hussain M Elius and Shifat Adnan in 2015.
