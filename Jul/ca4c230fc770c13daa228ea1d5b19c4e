African Travel Quarterly has said it will announce nominations for the 2020 edition of Top 100 Tourism Personalities in Nigeria. The award is expected to honour personalities in the travel and tourism sector that had been exemplary in the industry and contributed to the growth and development of the sector. The Top 100 Tourism Personalities in Nigeria would also recognise tourism experts who had promoted and advanced the fortunes of Nigeriaâ€™s tourism and hospitality industry. The Tourism 100 club is a list of the biggest and the best tourism practitioners in Nigeria. The Top 100 Tourism personality list would unveil top players in the tourism industry and would also enable government, foreign missions and various corporate bodies to know whom to engage when it comes to tourism in Nigeria. The 2020 Top 100 Tourism Personalities in Nigeria will also be inducted into the Seven Wonders Project. They will be part of the nomination process to discover the wonders embedded in different regions of the country between June 2020 and November 2021. It will involve seven man-made and seven natural wonders of Nigeria. The process would involve government who would nominate as many locations as they desire. Members of the Tourism Club 100 Nigeria in the 2018, 2019, and 2020 class will act as judges to make a shortlist from the initial list nominated by the government. The public will start voting from November.
