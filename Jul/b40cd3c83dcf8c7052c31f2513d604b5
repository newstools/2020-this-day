Real Sociedad’s slim hopes of qualifying for the Champions League were practically ended with a disappointing 1-1 draw at Levante on Monday. The Basque side went ahead in the 12th minute through an audacious flick into the net from Sweden forward Alexander Isak but Levante’s Jose Luis Morales levelled soon after, scampering on to a long ball and powering his way into the area to score. Sociedad were fourth in the standings in March when action in La Liga was suspended due to the Covid-19 pandemic but have only picked up five points in seven games since the re-start. They are seventh on 51 points, six behind Sevilla who were in action against Eibar later on Monday. Levante are 12th on 43 points. Meanwhile, Joao Felix will miss Atletico Madrid’s game against Celta Vigo today after the club confirmed he has an ankle injury. Felix came off in the second half of Atletico’s 3-0 win over Real Mallorca on Saturday and medical tests revealed “he suffered from traumatic bone edema of the ankle”, Atletico said on Monday. The Spanish outfit would not offer an estimated recovery time but it is expected Felix will miss the game against Celta at least. With remaining matches against Real Betis, Getafe and Real Sociedad squeezed into the next two weeks, Felix might struggle to play again in the league this season. Atletico, who are third in La Liga, will also be without Diego Costa against Celta due to suspension.
