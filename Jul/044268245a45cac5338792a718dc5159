By Femi Solajawith agency report Ahead of Napoli’s announcement of Victor Osimhen’s switch to the Naples-based club, Belgian forward and the Serie A team’s star, Dries Mertens has promised to help the Nigerian starlet settle in the Italian squad next season. “I want to help the team and the young people like Victor (Osimhen), that’s my future. I want to help Osimhen and Petagna, we can play together. “It’s difficult to come from another country and settle in, we must help them fit in here,” stressed the Belgian international. Napoli are expected to announce the deal to sign Osimhen from Lille with Italian sources assuring it’s €50m plus bonuses and Orestis Karnezis. Italian sporting press reported yesterday that little details like commissions to agents and the payment schedule rather than any serious issues are the things delaying the announcement of the deal by Napoli. The 21-year-old Osimhen has been in stellar form for the Ligue 1, with the forward scoring 13 goals in 25 appearances as Lille finished the 2019-20 season in fourth place. Osimhen only signed for the French Ligue 1 club last year from Sporting Charleroi after impressing on loan at the Belgian First Division A side in the 2018-19 season.
