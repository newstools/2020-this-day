The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has filed cyber fraud charges against two lawyers who allegedly rigged the August 2018 Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) national elections. The anti-graft agency accused Sarah Omeigha Ajibola, and John Ozovehe Demide of manipulating the election in favour of incumbent NBA President, Mr. Paul Usoro (SAN). It alleged that they altered 1004 eligible voters’ personal details and cast votes for Usoro by impersonating voters.
