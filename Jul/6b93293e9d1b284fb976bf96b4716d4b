The House of Representatives yesterday told the World Health Organisation (WHO) to be fair in its regulation of clinical trials for COVID-19 drugs and vaccines. Chairman of the House Committee on Health Services, Hon. Tanko Sununu, said this in Abuja at a meeting with the new WHO Representative in Nigeria, Dr. Walter Mulombo, and five health-related committees of the House. Sununu noted that the outgoing country representative maintained a healthy relationship with the National Assembly, especially the health committees, saying he hoped that Mulombo would relate with the parliament same way. He said, “We want to call on WHO to always remember that principles of ethics, especially now that we are moving towards both national and international clinical trials is to ensure that the principle of justice in medical researches is attained. “By justice, it means all human beings are equal and the benefit of that research is translated to all, so that there is no segment of the world that will be used as a scapegoat in trying to achieve something. This is the only way we can see that WHO has been fair in this fight against COVID-19 and ensure that each individual reaches his height.” Earlier, Mulombo said as chairmen of health committees, the lawmakers were called to higher service to humanity, adding that they were expected to use their functions of legislation, appropriation, representation and oversight to impact the health of Nigerians, majority of who are poor and vulnerable. “I have heard of the tremendous support you are already providing to the health sector, including appropriation of the Basic Healthcare Provision Fund and ongoing review of many health laws such as the National Health Insurance, National Primary Healthcare Development Agency, National Cancer, and National Blood Transfusion Bills.”
