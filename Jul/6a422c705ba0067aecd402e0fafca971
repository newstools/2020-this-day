A 59-year-old pastor of Light Christian Church in the Odeda Local Government Area of Ogun State, Oketokun Abiodun, has been arrested by men of the Ogun State Police Command for allegedly defiling a 10-year-old girl. The pastor reportedly lured the victim to his room and had unlawful carnal knowledge of her. The state Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, in a statement, said the suspect was arrested on Saturday. He said, “The pastor was arrested following a report by the father of the victim, who reported at the Odeda Police Station. “The complainant said the pastor saw his daughter playing with other children and called her to go and bring a key for him in his room. “While the innocent girl was going into the room, the pastor followed her, pushed her to the bed, covered her mouth with his hands and forcefully had carnal knowledge of her. “Upon the report, the DPO Odeda division, CSP Ajayi Williams, detailed his detectives to the scene where the randy pastor was promptly arrested.” According to the police spokesman, the pastor confessed to the crime during interrogation and was subsequently detained. He added that the victim was taken to the General Hospital, Odeda, for medical attention.
