Arik Air on Tuesday resumed flight operations to Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport, Kano and Yola Airport. Both services would originate from Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja with connections to and fro Murtala Muhammed Airport, Lagos. Arik Air would be operating separate flights from Abuja to Kano and Yola. Flights from Abuja to Kano would operate four times weekly on Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Sunday, while flights from Abuja to Yola would operate three times weekly, on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. Passengers traveling from Lagos can connect seamlessly to these services from Abuja. The airline assured passengers of their safety and well-being at every stage of their flight, as the airline has put various measures in place in line with COVID-19 health protocols as recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO), Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and the federal government. The airline also reiterated the need for passengers to use their facemasks at every stage of their flights and arrive at least one and a half hours before their scheduled departure time. The Chief Executive Officer of Arik Air, Capt. Roy Ilegbodu said: “We are delighted to recommence services to Kano and Yola following the approval for the reopening of the airports by the NCAA. “We shall continue to review our operations as more airports are given official permission to reopen to ensure we serve our customers efficiently.”
