The National Leader of All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Bola Tinubu, has commiserated with the Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Hon. Mudashiru Obasa, over the death of the member representing Kosofe Constituency II, Hon. Tunde Braimoh. The late lawmaker was the Chairman of the House Committee on Information, Strategy and Security of the House. He died in the early hours of Friday after a brief illness and his remains were buried same day in accordance with Muslim rites. In a condolence letter to Obasa, his Media Office, Tinubu said he was shocked and distressed by the news of Braimoh’s death. “Indeed, it was one piece of news that rendered me and certainly all those who knew him and what he stood for, momentarily numb and speechless. This is one death too many in such a short space of time. As mortals, we can only submit to the sovereignty of Almighty Allah,” he said. The former Lagos State governor described the late lawmaker as not just a political ally, but a dyed-in-the-wool progressive, who devoted his talents, resources, and life to the service and wellbeing of not only the people of Kosofe but also the citizens and residents of Lagos State.
