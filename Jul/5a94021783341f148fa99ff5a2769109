Chuks Okocha in Abuja The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Edo State has denied sponsoring the reported Sunday attack on Gani Audu, the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship running mate in Agbede. The PDP said the accusation by the APC was unfounded, as it said the attack ‘flowed’ from what the party described as Audu’s poor performance as a local government chairman and legislator. It was reported that the attack by youths occurred when Audu visited the traditional ruler of Agbede. Responding to the APC’s claim that the attack was sponsored by the PDP, spokesman of the PDP in the state, Chris Nehikhare, said: “The people of Agbede in Etsako West Local Government Area of the state last Sunday woke up to a protest against one of their sons who they had declared persona non grata in their town, following his poor performance while serving as the chairman of the local government area, and for denying them representation at the state House of Assembly after he was duly elected, but refused to present himself to be sworn into office. “Strangely, the APC woke up on the wrong side of the bed days after the widely reported incident to accuse the PDP of sponsoring the Agbede protest.” He further said in a statement made available to journalists in Abuja that “we wish to state that the PDP did not sponsor the protest. For emphasis, we don’t sponsor protests. The claim by APC that the protest was sponsored by our party, the PDP, is a figment of their imagination. “It is an established fact that Audu performed woefully as a local government chairman among other allegations leveled against him by his kinsmen, therefore, the youths must be commended for the courage they displayed in expressing their discontent over Audu’s failings and betrayal of the trust reposed in him by his people, who elected him to deliver the dividends of democracy.”
