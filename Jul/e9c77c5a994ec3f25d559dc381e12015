By John Shiklam President Muhammadu Buhari’s nephew, Mamman Daura, reputed to be one of the most influential persons in the corridors of power, has spoken on his relationship with the President. In an interview with the BBC Hausa Service, Tuesday, Daura, who had been reported to have a strong influence on Buhari, says he usually advise the President, but does not tell him what to do. “He is my uncle, he is my father’s younger brother. My father is the first born of their mother and General Buhari is their last,” Daura said, while explaining his relationship with President Buhari. Asked whether it was true that he and the president spent their younger years together, he said, “It is true we were together,” adding that he has been visiting the President to greet him and advise him. “I do visit him to greet him. I do offer him advice, but I don’t just go and tell him what to do. You don’t do that with the government,” he said. The octogenarian also spoke on agitations in some sections of the country for power shift as the nation heads towards 2023 general election. Daura said the time had come for the country to unite and embrace competence. “This turn by turn, it was done once, it was done twice, it was done trice… “It is better for this country to be one… It should be for the most competent and not for someone who comes from somewhere,” he said in an apparent vote against rotation of political power.
