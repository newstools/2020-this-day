By Ejiofor Alike As the Justice Ayo Salami-led panel probing the suspended acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) gets ready to submit its report, the Presidency last night asked Nigerians to prepare for surprises. The Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, said this on Channels Television’s ‘Politics Today’ programme. Shehu said the Presidency had been receiving some little updates from the panel, stressing that the findings would surprise Nigerians. He, therefore, asked Nigerians to ignore the outbursts of certain persons who have questioned the probe. Responding to a question on claims by Magu’s lawyers that the probe was a witch-hunt, Shehu said, “I guess this is a question for the Justice Ayo Salami panel and I must say that panel is composed of some of this country’s most honoured people with integrity who will do the right thing. “I am not going to pre-empt the panel investigation but I just advice Nigerians to hold their hearts in their hands. By the time they are done with this job and they come out with the reports- prepare yourselves for surprises. “I don’t know what will come out but if the sense we are getting from what is being done over there is anything to go by, I think that Nigerians should not be confused by any outbursts by anybody.” Shehu noted that the probe of Magu could cause temporary embarrassment to the President Buhari but expressed optimism that the Buhari-led government would be vindicated at last.
