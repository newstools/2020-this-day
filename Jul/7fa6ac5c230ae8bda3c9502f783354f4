James Sowole in Akure Ondo State Governor, Mr Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, has directed his Special Adviser on Health, Dr Jibayo Adeyeye, to oversee activities of the Ministry of Health. Equally, the governor has appointed the Vice Chancellor of the University of Medical Sciences, Ondo, Professor Adesegun Fatusi, as the new Chairman of the State Inter-ministerial Committee Against COVID-19. The appointments followed the death of the Health Commissioner, Dr Wahab Adegbenro, who also doubled as the Chairman of the committee on COVID-19 in Ondo State. The appointment of Adeyeye and Fatusi was contained in a statement signed by the Senior Special Assistant to the Governor of Media and Publicity, Mr Ojo Oyewamide. Adeyeye, a two-term lawmaker at the Lagos State House of Assembly is a product of the College of Medicine, University of Lagos. Fatusi is expected to continue from where the late Adegbenro stopped so as to prevent a vacuum as the state experiences a disturbing spike in cases of COVID-19. Fatusi is a professor of Community and Public Health and past Provost of the College of Health Sciences at the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ile-Ife, Nigeria. He had previously served as the Director of the OAU’s Institute of Public Health and worked with the UNFPA as reproductive health advisor.
