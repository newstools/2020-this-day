Udora Orizu in Abuja The House of Representatives at the plenary has mandated its Committee on Banking and Currency to commence full investigation into the activities of the Development Finance Department of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), the Nigeria Incentive-Based Risk Sharing System for Agricultural Lending (NIRSAL) and any other such schemes under the department. The Committee is to report back to the House within eight weeks for further legislative action. The resolution followed the adoption of a motion, titled, “Need to Investigate the Activities of the Development Finance Department of the Central Bank of Nigeria and the Nigeria Incentive–Based Risk Sharing System for Agricultural Lending (NIRSAL) that sponsored yesterday by Hon. Jaha Usman. Usman said while moving the motion that the Management of NIRSAL Microfinance Bank Ltd is reported to have allegedly diverted over N billion into a personal account of one of the management staff. He noted that the House is aware that the Development Finance Department of CBN, in line with its mandate formulates and manages several schemes and initiatives including the NIRSAL, the Anchor Borrowers’ Programme (ABP), the Commercial Agriculture Credit Scheme (CACS) and the Agricultural Credit Guarantee Scheme Fund (ACGSF) and so on. He also expressed concerns that several schemes and initiatives being managed by the Development Finance Department like the NIRSAL were designed to provide farmers with affordable financial products and reduce the risk of financial institutions that grant loans to them like the Anchor Borrowers’ Programme (ABP), the Commercial Agriculture Credit Scheme (CACS) and the N235 billion SME’s Credit Guarantee Scheme (SMECGS) are replete with irregularities that hinded its optimal performance. The lawmaker also expressed concerns that the N300 billion Real Sector Support Facility (RSSF) established in 2014 to address the funding needs of large ticket SMEs in Nigeria as well as create jobs through the real sector of the Nigerian economy has remained a dormant initiative. He also made reference to the N200 billion for the SME Restructuring/Refinancing Fund (RRF), which was suddenly discontinued by the management of the bank without any explanation to relevant government agencies and key stakeholders.
