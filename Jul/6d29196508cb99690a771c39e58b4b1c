By Adedayo Akinwale The National Assembly Service Commission (NASC) has queried the Clerk of National Assembly, Mr. Mohammed Sani-Omolori, over what it described as ‘gross insubordination’. To this end, the commission has given Sani-Omolori 24 hours to reply the query to explain why disciplinary action should not be taken against him in accordance with the Act setting up the commission. The crisis between the Clerk and the commission worsened on Wednesday over the retirement age of workers of the National Assembly. While the commission, in a statement on Wednesday put the retirement age of the parliamentary workers at 60 or 35 years in service, the Assembly management disagreed in another release saying the retirement age stands at 65 or 40 years in service. But in a letter issued Thursday by the Executive Chairman of the Commission, Mr. Ahmed Amshi, insisted that Sani-Omolori is a staff of the Commission and has no right whatsoever to dictate to the commission. He stated: “The attention of the National Assembly Service Commission has been drawn to a Press Release titled “Retirement Age for staff of the National Assemby Service is 40 years of Service or 65 years of Age or whichever comes first dated 15th July, 2020 and signed by M A Sani Omolori, Clerk to the National Assembly. “As you are very much aware, the Clerk to the National Assembly is an employee of the National Assembly Service Commission vide Section 6(2)b of the National Assembly Service Act, 20H (As Amended). The Clerk to National Assembly has no authority whatsoever to dictate any thing to the Commission. Your Press Release is considered by the Commission as gross insorbordination to a constituted authority. “You are by this letter requested to explain to the Commission within 24 hours as to why disciplinary action Will not be taken against you as per the provision of Section 6(2) h of the National Assembly Service Act. 2014 (As Amended) for gross insubordination.”
