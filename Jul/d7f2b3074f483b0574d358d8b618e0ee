The founder/Chairman of Coronation Capital Limited, Mr. Aigboje Aig-Imoukhuede, yesterday said the company remains committed to building a continuous learning environment that empowers its employees. The former Access Bank CEO said this while welcoming participants to the second edition of the Coronation Capital Limited Corporate Finance and Business Valuation online training (Valuation Master Class). He said: “At Coronation Capital, we are strong believers in continuous learning, developing intellectual abilities. That is why whenever there is an opportunity to bring renowned academics, we seize it.” He noted that the company decided to invite globally renowned Professor Aswath Damodaran, a Professor of Finance at New York University’s Stern School of Business, who headlined the first edition of the Corporate Finance and Business Valuation Training Programme, to again handle this year’s edition of the event because, “there is no better person that will teach you how to value assets.” The four-day event continues and on 27th and 28th of July, 2020. It was designed to provide participants with a deeper understanding of corporate finance, valuation methodology and financial statement analysis with a key focus on appraising the business impact of financial decisions on the organisational performance. Damodaran, who has been referred to as Wall Street’s “Dean of Valuation,” is widely respected as one of the foremost experts on corporate valuation. He has been voted “Professor of the Year” by Stern’s graduating MBA class five times and has been awarded NYU’s Excellence in Teaching and Distinguished Teaching award. He has published several books and articles on equity valuation and corporate finance and has been featured in the Journal of Finance, the Journal of Financial Economics, and the Review of Financial Studies.
