By Ibrahim Oyewale Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, has condemned the attack on Agbudu community in Kogi/Koto Karfe Local Government Area of the state which has left many people dead with six others injured. Bello in a statement issued by his Chief Press Secretary, Onogwu Muhammed, which was made available to journalists in Lokoja yesterday, vowed to sustain the operations against criminal elements in the state. The governor, however, commiserated with the family of the victims of what he called “heinous and cowardly attack” on the community. Bello assured the people of Agbudu and other parts of the state that the government would continue to deploy all available resources to fight the ‘heartless’ criminal elements with a view to bringing them down on their knees. He said the marauders should make no mistake that they can unleash terror on the people without feeling the full might of the government which was elected to protect the citizens. Bello said whatever the cause of the attack may be, the criminals cannot escape the consequences of their dastardly act, declaring that the government is determined to frustrate and defeat them, and that no matter how far they run or hide, they would be smoked out and made to face the wrath of law. Unknown gunmen had stormed Agbudu community last Wednesday, killing some people and inflicting injuries on six others.
