Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja The suspended Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commision (EFCC), Mr Ibrahim Magu, Wednesday regained his freedom after 10 days in Police custody. Magu was arrested by security operatives at the Abuja Zonal office of the commision on his way to a meeting last week Monday. He was compelled to respond to an invitation to appear before the Justice Ayo Salami-led presidential panel probing the activities of the commision and alleged infractions. Counsel to Magu, Tosin Ojaomo Esq of Ojaomo & Ojaomo Chambers, told THISDAY that Magu regained his freedom Wednesday evening.
“Yes that is correct. This evening (Wednesday)”, she responded to inquiries about Magu’s release. Magu’s lawyer had written the Inspector-General of Police, Mr Mohammed Adamu, seeking his release. The IG had replied that Magu’s detention was not authorised by him but the presidential panel and urged the lawyer to redirect his attention to the presidential panel. A senior advocate of Nigeria, Tayo Oyetibo, had called for Magu’s release urging that his detention should not violate Section 35 of the 1999 Constitution. Other rights groups also made similar calls.
