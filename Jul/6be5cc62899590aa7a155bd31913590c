David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka Pan Igbo socio-cultural group, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, and the separatist Igbo group, Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) have mended fence with a promise to work together for the common good of the Igbo people. Both groups met yesterday at the home of the first Republic Aviation Minister, Chief Mbazuluike Amechi, in Ukpor, Nnewi South Local Government Area of Anambra State. Both groups have been at logger head recently, with the leader of IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu, calling on his members to attack the leader of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Dr Nnia Nwodo, anywhere he was seen. But Amechi, who met with the group, described the rivalry as unnecessary as they were both working for the good of the Igbo people. “I summoned the two bodies to express my displeasure with what I have been reading in the newspapers about Kanu giving orders for the stoning of Chief Nwodo. “I’m happy that even before this peace meeting, Kanu has retracted the statement. We, therefore, appeal to Nwodo to accept the retraction and get it off his mind as IPOB has agreed to work with them. “The two bodies must realise that it is the same battle they are fighting, which is marginalisation, killings and denial of federal government to develop South-east and Igbo land in general,” he stated. IPOB, represented by Aloy Ejimakor, counsel to Kanu, said he was at the meeting with the blessings and instructions of his client, just as he thanked Amaechi, who he said was not a stranger to what he was doing having been once declared a terrorist. Also, speaking on behalf of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, the Anambra State President of the body, Chief Damian Okeke-Ogene, said the body endorsed all that were contained in the communique. He said: “Those who thought our fences are fallen will know that the fences are much stronger than they thought.”
