“Seest thou a man diligent in his business? He shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before mean men.”
This applies to Harry Ebohon, the Edo State-born founder and CEO of Propetrol Limited. Nicknamed the Bunker King by those in Nigeria’s oil trade who recognise his excellence in the field, Ebohon has steadily grown his business from humble beginnings, to becoming a leading indigenous player in West Africa’s oil trade.
Propetrol is at the forefront of consolidating Nigeria’s position as a bunker trading hub on the West African coast. This has been achieved through ethical product sourcing, quality assurance and logistical expertise. A testament to the company’s growth is the spanking new ultra-modern edifice where Propetrol will be conducting its business from.
The all-white structure is situated on prime waterfront property, on the edge of the Five Cowrie Creek in Lagos. The liberal use of glass offers amazing views of the iconic Lekki-Ikoyi link bridge, while the tasteful paintings and sculpture would make an art gallery envious. The furniture is both regal and stylish, while the games section, canteen and gym – among other amenities – make it a worker’s delight. Through its aggressive expansion drive, Propetrol has extended its operations across the Gulf of Guinea, from Liberia to Ghana and Sao Tome, and into parts of Southern Africa. But Ebohon is desirous of expanding further, onshore and offshore. Sources say he has concluded plans to acquire storage facilities, open more Propel filling station, and procure an oil field.
