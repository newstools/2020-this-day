Indeed, 2020 would never be forgotten in a hurry. Just six months into the year, it has turned into a super sad year already and a very strange year for most people. A year many would have preferred to obliterate from their memories forever if it’s possible. When the news of the passing of Pamela Ndidi Bello, boss of BNatural Spa, broke a few days ago, not a few reportedly put a call to her family and friends to confirm its authenticity. This is not unexpected given the fact that the majority of the callers were not aware of her protracted battle with cancer. It was gathered that Bello, who until her death ran one of the biggest beauty spas in Nigeria with three branches, had returned to the country from her base in the US before the lockdown in the country over the coronavirus pandemic. While she was in the US, Bello, it was further learnt, was diagnosed with cancer, and placed on specific drugs. A source said, “When she was returning to the country, she came only with the quantity that could last her two months. But after the two months, she and her family went everywhere to look for the drugs, but couldn’t get them.”
