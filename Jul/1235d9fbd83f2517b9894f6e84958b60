There was pandemonium and sporadic gunshots thursday afternoon in Dei-Dei, a suburb of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), when police officers fired shots to disperse the FCT Mobile Court sitting to try violators of COVID-19 safety protocols. The incident was said to have thrown residents and motorists into confusion. Everyone, including the Magistrate, Prosecutors and other officials scampered for safety. Trouble was said to have started when personnel of the FCT Ministerial Joint Enforcement Task-team on COVID-19 Restrictions arrested a policeman (name withheld) for allegedly not wearing face mask and overloading his vehicle, a Gulf car with passengers. The culprit, who was arrested around the premises of the court, was said to have called on his colleague (name withheld) to resist his arraignment. It was gathered that the two were subsequently charged for the alleged offences and sentenced accordingly. But they were said to have refused to pay fines or engage in community service as directed by the court. The duo allegedly mobilised operatives from the Mobile Police Barracks in Dei-Dei who stormed the court, shooting sporadically. The policemen were said to have dismantled the courtâ€™s canopy and vowed they would no longer allow any sitting in the area. When contacted, Chairman of the Task-team, Ikharo Attah, said he had been adequately briefed about the development. He expressed confidence in the ability of the FCT Commissioner of Police, Bala Ciroma, to apprehend the erring personnel and mete out appropriate sanctions. When Contacted, FCT Police spokesman, DSP Anjuguri Manzah, said he had not been briefed on the situation.
