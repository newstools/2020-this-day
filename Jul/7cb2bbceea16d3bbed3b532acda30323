Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal of Sokoto state has called on stakeholders in the Northern region of the country to pool resources and capacity in order to rescue the area from its backwardness in the area of education. A statement issued by the Special Adviser Media and Publicity to the governor, Muhammad Bello, said Tambuwal made the call Tuesday when a delegation of the Committee of the Pro-Chancellors of Nigerian States’ Universities (CPCNSU) paid him a condolence visit over the death of the erstwhile Pro-Chancellor of the Sokoto State University, Barrister Inuwa Abdulkadir, at Government House, Sokoto. The governor, who commended the initiative to set up the CPCNSU, observed that the northern part of the country was still “lagging behind in terms of education.” He, therefore, applauded the forum, set up in 2005, which he said had “occupied themselves with the business of contributing to the development of education in our states and Nigeria in general.” “This is our collective responsibility to see that our younger ones are educated, particularly those children that are out of school. “We as leaders should provide them with basic education by creating the enabling environment and making provisions for necessary infrastructure, learning materials and personnel for the education of our younger ones,” Gov. Tambuwal said. In his speech, the leader of the delegation of the Pro-Chancellors, Gen. Muhammad Magoro (rtd), told the governor that they were in the state to condole with him and the people over the death of one of their members, Barrister Inuwa Abdulkadir. Gen. Magoro who noted that the deceased was a patriot who was vast in many fields of human endeavor, recalled that he was proactive as their member when he was alive. He prayed for the repose of his soul.
