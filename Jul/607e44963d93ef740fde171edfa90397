With the everyday twists to the many allegations against the suspended chairman of the Economic and Financial Commission (EFCC), Mr. Ibrahim Magu, it is hard to think of a plausible defence in his favour as his matter gets messier each passing day. After about six days in detention and the desperate plea for a bail, it is clear to many people now that those keeping Magu in detention have more than they can possible feed the public with as discoveries from their investigations, further complicating likely grounds for defence. Friday’s burgling of the office of the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) has further corroborated fears that there’s more to the corruption allegations than is already in the public space. Although all of Magu’s predecessors left under controversial circumstances, Magu’s situation is even he more niggling, the reason the investigation of his reign must be thorough, total and examples set with it.
