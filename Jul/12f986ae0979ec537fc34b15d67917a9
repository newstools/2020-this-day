In the bid to prepare leaders to handle the challenges of the post-COVID-19 era, renowned leadership expert, Mr. Linus Okorie convened the GOTNI Global Leadership Training with the theme: “Facing the Future Without Fear: Leading in Uncertain Times.” The well-attended two-day training saw leaders and aspiring leaders, business professionals and entrepreneurs join the class from across Africa, Europe, America and more. It featured talks on leadership, effective followership, networking, business and nation building, as well as personal effectiveness and other relevant insights needed to thrive in today’s world and beyond. Speakers at the landmark virtual event included acclaimed public speaker and self-development author, Brian Tracy; renowned American business executive and Chairman of FraserNet, Inc., George Fraser; Executive Coach and Behavioural Change Catalyst, Mr. Lanre Olusola; Investor and Real Estate Broker, Kristen Cripps; President of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Toki Mabogunje. Underscoring the essence of the training, Okorie charged delegates to be deliberately committed to effecting change and providing solutions to problems in these times. “If leadership does not exist, institutions will lose individuals who drive success.” He said. “The world will not give anything to you until you prove that you can sustain your vision’’ “Regardless of the various titles in leadership, a major title every leader should answer is problem solver” said keynote speaker, Tracy. “The words you choose to use in a crisis, determines the amount of control you have in that crisis,” he said. Olusola noted that critical among the leadership values that will transform organisations is the mindset of service and a desire to create an atmosphere that is devoid of paranoia and fear.
