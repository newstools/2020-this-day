A Non-Governmental Organisation, Global Social Mobilisation Foundation, has organised a special prayer summit to seek God’s intervention in the rise of violent crimes across the country. The foundation’s National President, Chaplain John Lawal Isyaku-Guga who organised the prayer summit in Danja Local Government Area of Katsina State, with the theme ‘Prayer of Patriotic Nigerians’, stressed the need for both Muslims and Christians to continue to dwell in harmony, do good to each other and be their brothers’ keepers. According to him, “If peaceful co-existence exists between the two major religions it will go a long way in bringing more development nationwide, because without peace there cannot be progress in society. “If fellow Nigerians can continue to pray for leaders and nation, we shall experience divine intervention in all sectors of our national life,” he said. Isyaku-Guga who commended former Head of State, Dr. Yakubu Gowon for tirelessly praying for Nigeria, said “prayer is the unseen weapon that works faster than guns in solving problems and challenges both at the state and national levels and internationally.” The highlight of the occasion was the presentation and inauguration officials of GSMF in Danja local government, special prayer session offered for both leaders at national, state and local government levels as well as prayer for an end to armed banditry and stop to spread of Coronavirus pandemic.
