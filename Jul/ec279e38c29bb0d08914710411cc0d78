Given the global impact of COVID-19 pandemic on Nigerians, Schneider Electric Foundation (SEF) has established a fund to combat the economic hardship facing rural and disadvantaged communities. The project will focus on provision of basic needs, including meals for underprivileged children and communities. Sharing his thoughts on the gesture, the Project Coordinator, Access to Energy, LEAP Africa, Mr. Isaac Adeleke, whose nongovernmental organisation was entrusted with the donations, said: “The initiative, known as Tomorrow Rising Fund, gave Schneider Electric staff the opportunity to donate to the noble cause to help alleviate the hardship in communities. “The implementation of the project will be done in two phases. The first will focus on the basic needs, specifically meals for underprivileged children and communities across the country. “The second phase, which started in June until December 2020, will focus on understanding the current situation and needs/risks of education partners in anglophone Africa with the deployment of support in existing education projects. “In addition, there will be assessment to confirm digital training requirements for student engagement to reduce drop out and ensure continuous learning and possible support via the Schneider Electric Academy.” Schneider Electric said that the staff of the company donated €1210 while the Schneider Electric Foundation donated €10,550, bringing the total remitted funds for LEAP Africa to €11,760.00. Adeleke said that under the phase one of the initiative, the Foundation in partnership with LEAP Africa will provide 13,000 meals across Nigeria.
