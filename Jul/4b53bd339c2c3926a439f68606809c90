Manchester United’s Portuguese star, Bruno Fernandes namechecked Odion Ighalo as he discussed about the quality players manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer can call upon from the bench. The Norwegian football tactician is not expected to make alterations to his starting lineup in attack today when Southampton visit Old Trafford this evening for a game that is likely to lift United to the Top Four log of the English topflight. Mason Greenwood, Frenchman Anthony Martial and England star Marcus Rashford have scored a combined 56 goals between them in all competitions this term. Five months after his arrival at Manchester United, Ighalo is still waiting to make his full Premier League debut but has been one of their key players in Cup competitions, netting five goals in his first four starts. Speaking to the Manchester United’s official website yesterday, Fernandes explained : “We have a lot of quality on the bench – Odion (Ighalo) scored in the FA Cup against Norwich and we also have players like Dan James, Jesse (Lingard), Juan (Mata), Chongy (Tahith Chong). “So we know when we’re tired and we need some freshness, we have a lot of players for the end of the season. It’s easy to play with these kind of players,” observed the player who has turned around the Red Devils’ game since his arrival at Old Trafford. Fernandes who was voted United’s Player of the month of June, is particularly excited with options upfront. “Anthony (Martial) is playing very well and scoring goals, which is what you want as a striker, and Mason is a young kid who is scoring every time in different ways, so you always need to expect something new from him,”” added our Player of the Month.
