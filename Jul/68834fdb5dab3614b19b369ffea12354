The senator representing Borno South, Ali Ndume has condemned the idea of granting amnesty to repentant Boko Haram fighters, saying that many of the fighters granted amnesty have taken back to terrorism. Ndume, who is also the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Army, queried federal government’s decision to reform the insurgents, revealing that one of the repentant fighters recently disappeared after killing and robbing his father. He spoke in a BBC Hausa Service programme monitored in Kaduna yesterday. “This government’s progra-mme is unacceptable to our people. The right thing is to stop it, forthwith. “Haba! Not that he even apologised to you; he apologised to the government. His thinking was that government has failed and that is why they are being pampered. “They are like Kharajites. Many among those released have since ran away. They will never repent. “The government should know what to do about them. But not re-introducing someone to you, who has killed your parent, or your relations. “If there is sincerity of purpose in this, those in the IDP camps should be trained in various trades and vocation so that they could start life again.” A widow, who also featured on the BBC, condemned the amnesty programme for Boko Haram. According to her: “This thing is painful. They killed my husband in my presence; they killed my son. I am left suffering with four young orphans. Till death, I will never forget that day. “I was left with orphans, with no help or assistance. See how harsh life is today, someday we eat, another day we stay hungry. That is how we are suffering with the children. “Look at the kind of care given to the Boko Haram members. We that have suffered for six years now; we are not taken care of but the repentant Boko Haram, truly government has not done justice here.”
