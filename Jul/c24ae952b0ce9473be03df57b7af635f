The Chief Judge of the Federal High Court, Justice John Tsoho, has suspended indefinitely the annual redeployment of the court’s judges, which began nearly eight months ago. Justice Tsoho said the suspension followed the effects of the Coronavirus pandemic. The CJ, in a July 13 circular sighted yesterday, directed judges to resume hearing of all cases pending before them. Many cases have been stalled and many judges have been unable to hear new matters since December following uncertainty about their posting schedule. The circular, titled ‘Suspension of transfer of Judges’, reads: Your Lordships are by this circular informed that in view of the difficulties and uncertainties brought about by the emergence of the Covid-19 Pandemic, posting of Judges has been suspended till further notice. “In the meantime, Judges should attend to ALL cases pending before them.” On Friday, Justice Tsoho went on self-isolation following a confirmed case of COVID -19. The CJ, in a statement by the FHC’s acting Information Officer, Catherine Oby Nwandu, also ordered some key staff in his office to do same, pending the results of screening tests conducted on him, members of his immediate family and close aides. “The Court is thus following medical protocols and all precautionary measures for the COVID – 19 prescribed by global and national health authorities. Mr Tsoho urged the staff of the court to go about their lawful duties while ensuring that they are well protected.
