By Adibe Emenyonu The Enogie of Ologbo Dukedom in Ikpba-Okha Local Government Area (LGA) of Edo State, Prince Jason Akenzua has dragged the Iyatsere of Warri Kingdom, Chief Johnson Aseleghe before an Edo State High Court in Benin over alleged land tussle. In the interlocutory injunction filed before Justice Iyobosa Okungbowa, Prince Akenzua also urged the court to restrain the defendant from also parading himself as the traditional ruler of Ologbo Dukedom. The Enogie of Ologbo informed Justice Okungbowa that the alleged action of Iyatsere of Warri Kingdom, especially for selling plots of land in Ologbo was capable of breaching peace in Ologbo. The claimant, through his Solicitor, Mr. Chris Otasowie asked the court to urgently restrain defendant (Aseleghe), pending the determination of the suit. Akenzua said the alleged unwarranted incursion into Ologbo Dukedom had led to loss of lives and destruction of property. He urged the court to compel the defendant to attend solely to the traditional activities of his kingdom and stop parading himself as the traditional ruler of Ologbo Dukedom. “It’s on gazette that all the villages within Ologbo are under the control of the Dukedom in Benin Kingdom as such, no one from Warri Kingdom in Delta State can lay claims to the Dukedom because he can access some of these villages through Delta. This era is no longer the era of conquest,” he argued. The Enogie noted that the alleged nefarious activities of the defendant, if left unchecked, could lead to a situation that might not be palatable hence the need for the court to intervene to save lives and property. When the matter came up for hearing yesterday, neither Chief Aseleghe nor his counsel was in court. Justice Okungbowa adjourned the case to September 25, for ruling on the injunction
