Udora Orizu in Abuja The Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP) has urged the federal government to prosecute all indicted public office holders in accordance with the laws of the land in order to demonstrate its commitment to the war against corruption. A statement issued by the Chairman of CUPP’s Contact and Mobilisation Committee, Mr. Olusegun Peters, said there should be no sacred cow in the fight against corruption if the nation would be rid of this cankerworm that has eaten deep in the fabric of the country. According to the CUPP: ‘’For long the President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration has tackled corruption with a kid’s glove, which resulted to the escalation of corruption cases in the country including the suspended EFCC’s Acting Chairman, Mr. Ibrahim Magu, who is currently facing investigation. ‘’From the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation to the Niger Delta Development Commission, through the National Social Investment Programme that disbursed billions of Naira for curious palliatives including feeding students at home during the lockdown, the nation stinks of corruption. “Government should accelerate the trial of those indicted of corrupt practices as justice delayed amounts to justice denied. The era of prosecuting public officeholders charged with corruption for over 12 years is unfair, unjust, unacceptable, despicable and justice juxtaposed.’’ The coalition called for the establishment special court for speedy handling of corruption-related matters to avoid corruption fighting back with looted funds.
