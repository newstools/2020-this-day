Mind Yard 204 Entertainment and ContentGram Media, the Producers of the successful Television series “Squatterz” and “90 Gogoro” returns with this brand new family sitcom called Birds of a Feather. Birds of a Feather is a comedy series featuring a family of four called The Abiola family. The family’s Patriarch is Justice Tunde Abiola played by veteran actor Segun Arinze who has been a widower with two adult kids for 5 years but who is ready to remarry. The biggest concern is how the children’s decision will be made and how they’ll respond toward a new mother. The drama, laughter and shenanigans are refreshing, because we are reminded with each episode that we might not choose our families, but there is no imitation for any families that, given the odds, holds together. The cast includes top Nollywood acts like Segun Arinze, Francis Duru, and more. Notable appearances from Zeal of Styl Plus, AGN Team and more. Seun Arowojolu, producer of the series, had this to say, “I’ve always loved making family friendly shows that cater to all ages and just make people laugh. Those storylines are essentially brought to life by our daily occurrences. Especially with this cast, it was exciting to create this show and can’t wait for everyone to watch it”. On working with Segun Arinze, “There’s a reason why he’s one of the film industry ‘s pioneers, his work ethics and respect for art is really motivating and easy to work with,” Seun says.
