Manchester City and Juventus ‘lead the race to sign Wolves winger Adama Traore ahead of Barcelona’ in this summer transfer window. The powerful 24-year-old is attracting attention from Europe’s top clubs having terrorised Premier League defences all season. And according to ESPN, it is now Pep Guardiola’s side and Italian champions Juventus looking most likely to secure a deal for the £80million-rated star. Traore has been at the heart of Wolves’ push for European qualification with four goals and nine assists in the Premier League. He has three years left on his current contract, putting his club in a strong negotiating position. Barcelona, where Traore played in the academy before moving to England, are also interested but will only attempt to bring him back next year as the club need to focus on outgoing players this summer. The departure of Leroy Sane to Barcelona could lead City to signing a new wide player. And Juventus need to reduce the average age of their front-line, with Cristiano Ronaldo and Juan Cuadrado aged 35 and 32 respectively and Douglas Costa turning 30 in September. Traore joined Wolves for £18million from Middlesbrough in August 2018 and has since gone from strength to strength at Molineux. It is thought that if Wolves qualify for the Champions League this season that he would remain at the club.
