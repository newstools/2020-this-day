This was disclosed by the Chairman, Forum of Commissioners for Finance of the Federation, Hon. David Olofu, during a solidarity visit to the Accountant General of the Federation (AGF), Mr. Ahmed Idris, Wednesday. This is as the AGF further reiterated the commitment of his office to see through the efficient implementation of the various financial reforms of the federal government. Olofu had alongside the acting Chairman, Committee on Indices and Allocation of the forum and Commissioner for Finance and Economic Development, Gombe State, Mallam Muhammad Gambo Magaji, embarked on a solidarity visit to Idris to commiserate with him over the recent fire outbreak at the Treasury House in Abuja.

He also expressed relief that no documents relating to federation accounts were destroyed in the fire outbreak.
