Mary Nnah The General Overseer (GO) of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Pastor Enoch Adeboye has donated 8,000 hand sanitisers, 8,000 surgical face masks and 200,000 hand gloves to support the efforts of the Lagos State government in equipping medical staff with necessary protective gears needed to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. While presenting the donations at Mainland Hospital, Lagos, the Assistant General Officer, Admin/Personnel, RCCG Pastor Johnson Funsho Odesola representing the GO, said: “We commend the sacrifices of medical personnel at this time. “The church will continue to pray for them as they give their sacrifice of love even as the RCCG as a church agrees that combating COVID-19 is a work for all. “This donation of medical supplies is in addition to other supports given by the RCCG to the Nigerian health sector, ahead of the COVID-19 pandemic. “The RCCG delivered on its commitment to strengthen and support the Nigerian healthcare system with the donation of 11 ICU beds fully fitted with ventilators in Lagos, Ogun and Plateau States to contribute to improvement of healthcare facilities in Nigeria which is now found to be very useful as the government works round the clock to curtail the pandemic.” Other interventions by RCCG are; Kirikiri Maximum Prison Referral Hospital refurbished and equipped to provide a decent medical facility for the inmates; Healing Stripes Cancer Screening and Diagnostics Centre which have screened over 100,761 people at subsidised rates and Healing Stripes Dialysis Centre which has about 9,505 completed sessions at subsidised cost and a good number done for free.
