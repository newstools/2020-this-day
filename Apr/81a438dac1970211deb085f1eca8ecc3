The Governor of Kaduna State, Malam Nasir el-Rufai, has said his phones were seized during the time he was receiving treatment for COVID-19. El-Rufai recovered from COVID-19 nearly four weeks after he tested positive for the disease.a In an interview in a Hausa Radio programme yesterday, the governor recounted his experience, saying he could have died from complications. “I could have died, if not for my doctors. I followed their instructions strictly and took my medications,” el-Rufai said in Hausa. “My wives collaborated with the deputy governor and seized my phones while in isolation. I was only left with an iPad, the device I used to read and go online. “I survived it, someone else may not, that is why we are very serious about the disease. I went through trauma, even when I spoke online from isolation, I was battling with a debilitating headache. I won’t like even my enemy to suffer from coronavirus. “I can’t exactly say how I contracted the coronavirus. But I was in Abuja and had interacted with many people, some from overseas. “I was assigned to chair committees by the government. I believe it was from these interactions that I got the virus.” Noting that the disease does not distinguish between the rich or poor, he advised people to comply with health guidelines to prevent COVID-19. “Despite the security around me, I got the virus. This goes to show that the virus does not recognise any personality,” he said. Speaking on why he returned to his clean shave looks, El-Rufai said: “I’m truly aging. I am a few steps above 60 and this disease is not kind to the old. I am old. That is the danger. “If one is above 50, one should be very careful not to contract the virus. To an aged person with other health complications like diabetes, hypertension, coronavirus will be very deadly.“
