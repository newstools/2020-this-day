By Laleye Dipo The senator representing Niger east senatorial zone of Niger State in the National Assembly, Senator Mohammed Sani Musa, has again released palliatives to members of his constituents, the second time within one month. This time around Musa is giving 9,990 households in the 90 wards in the constituency various food items which include bags of rice, vegetable oil, noodles, maize, detergents, salt and seasoning. Each household will get a pack containing all of the items. At a brief ceremony held in Minna on Wednesday, Senator Musa, who was represented by his Personal Assistant, Alhaji Sagir Tafida, said the “gesture is to cushion the effect of the lockdown on members of the constituency”. Tafida said: “Senator Musa is aware of the plight of our people as a result of the lockdown and their inability to carry out their day-to-day business hence the decision to release the second phase of the palliative. “You cannot keep people at home and not cater for them. We feel we should reach out to our people and help them to keep body and soul together.” To ensure the palliatives get to the targeted beneficiaries, Tafida said: “We have put in place a monitoring committee that will work closely with the committees in each of the local government areas. We are taking nine days to do the distribution. Each day, we will focus on a particular local government area and make sure everyone is covered before we move to another local government the next day. “So, you can be sure that there will be no room for anyone to divert the items.” Representatives from each of the local government areas at the event commended Musa’s efforts and urged other politicians and appointees in the Senatorial zone to emulate the “good gesture”. A month ago, Musa, during a similar exercise, shared 900 bags of rice, condiments to the nine local government areas in his constituency.
