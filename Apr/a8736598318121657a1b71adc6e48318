By Seriki Adinoyi As Plateau State goes into a total lockdown from midnight Thursday, April 9 to Wednesday April 15, 2020, the state Governor Simon Lalong has urged security agents to be firm in enforcing compliance, but to also be professional and observe all rules of engagement. The governor, who gave the warning in a statement signed by the state Commissioner for Information, Dan Majang, also appealed to citizens “to bear with this unusual situation and make sacrifices because the problem is not peculiar to Plateau State, but is a global challenge as the world battles this pandemic”. The statement added that government has set up 10 mobile courts to try violators of the order. “The establishment of the mobile courts is meant to ensure enforcement and compliance to the directive of government which is aimed at protecting the citizens from the coronavirus pandemic and also ensuring that the entire state is fumigated. “Members of the public are therefore advised to comply with the ‘no movement’ order while those exempted because of their essential services are to carry their identify cards at all times,” he said. While urging security agencies to be firm in enforcing compliance, “the governor wants them to remain professional and observe all rules of engagement, warning that any security personnel who overreach his mandate by engaging in corrupt conduct or brutality will be held accountable”. The state also gave out situation room emergency response numbers for members of the public to call should the need arise. The numbers which, according to the statement, will be available 24 hours are 07057326212 and 08186015907.
