The Borno State Government has identified 99 people believed to have had contact with the index case of COVID-19 in the state. Deputy Governor Umar Kadafur disclosed at a news conference in Maiduguri, the state capital. The index case was a health worker with the Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) – Doctors Without Border –, an international organisation offering humanitarian service in the North East. Until his death on Saturday last week, the patient worked in Pulka, a district in Gwoza Local Government Area of Borno State housing thousands of displaced persons. Kadafur, who is also the Chairman of the Borno State High-Powered Committee on the Prevention and spread of COVID-19, told reporters that 99 people of interest have been traced. He explained that 35 people had contact with the index case in Pulka where he was working before he developed symptoms while the remaining 64 were his contacts in Maiduguri who attended to him in a hospital or had contact with his remains.
