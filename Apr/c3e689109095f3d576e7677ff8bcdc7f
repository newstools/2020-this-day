Femi Solaja with agency report Former Super Eagles Captain and goalkeeper, Vincent Enyeama, has said that he has nothing against former national team coach, Sunday Oliseh, despite the row which led to his exit from the Super Eagles. The former goalkeeper had a row with the 45-year-old tactician which forced him to early retirement from the national team Enyeama was stripped of the captain’s armband by Oliseh after he took charge of the former African champions in 2015 and handed it over to the present captain, Ahmed Musa. The decision generated uproar in the team and forced Enyeama to abruptly end his international career spanning 13 years. “I have nothing against Oliseh. What happened in the past is in the past,” Enyeama told Super Eagles media in a live Instagram chat. “I still have his number on my phone and probably he has mine. If I have my chance I would sit and have breakfast with him,” the former Lille safe hands cleared the air on his relationship with Oliseh. Enyeama, whose first World Cup appearance was Korea/Japan 2002 and was a surprise replacement in the last group match against England in the tournament but went further to play at the 2010 edition in South Africa and finally at the 2014 Mundial in Brazil. To his credit, Enyeama earned 101 caps for the Super Eagles and helped the team to win the 2013 AFCON for Nigeria in South Africa. Interestingly, the row between the duo largely affected the team’s qualification for the 2017 AFCON tournament following Oliseh’s resignation from the team in 2016.
