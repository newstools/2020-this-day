By Segun Awofadeji in Bauchi A Chinese group, Mutual Commitment Group (MCG), has donated medical protection materials to the Bauchi State Government to support the ongoing fight against the spread of coronavirus and other deadly diseases in the state. The Group’s Managing Director, Mr Lui Zhaolong, Friday said the group is donating 150,000 protection medical materials to assist Nigeria in curbing the spread of COVID-19. Zhaolong said the group will continue to do its best by ensuring that Chinese and Nigerian citizens live together as one family to defeat the coronavirus pandemic, believing that what China achieved in the past two months will definitely be replicated in Nigeria. According to him, Mutual Commitment Group is a Chinese organisation that has been in Nigeria for many years and has projects in different sectors across the country among which are security projects. “As outbreak of coronavirus in Nigeria runs out beyond expectation and established increasing damages to the people and the nation, especially to the health and lives of the health workers from different
originations in the front of this war of counter coronavirus. We feel that it is our duty to contribute in this regard. “We are sorry for your suffering on the coronavirus and sorry for the challenges in front of the state. We hereby give 2,000 surgical facemasks and 2,000 medical gloves as the immediate first donation,” he said. Earlier, the state Deputy Governor, Senator Baba Tela, who received the donation on behalf of the state government, expressed gratitude to the group for the gesture. Tela, who was represented by the state Commissioner for Health, Dr Aliyu Maigoro, said the donation of the materials will go a long way in assisting the state government to consolidate on its fight against the coronavirus in the state. This donation was facilitated by the state Accountant General, Alhaji Abubakar Saidu, and the Senior Special Assistant to the governor on Liason, Alhaji Maula Aliyu.
