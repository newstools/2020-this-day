A statement by the state Commissioner for Information and Communications, Kingsley Fanwo, in Lokoja on Thursday, said that religious bodies should return for worship. According to the statement, “Following the directive of His Excellency, Alhaji Yahaya Bello, the Executive Governor of Kogi State that the ban on religious congregations be lifted with immediate effect to allow religious bodies have their normal worship and services.” The statement also urged religious leaders to put in place the following preventive measures by providing sanitizers for all worshippers at the entrance of churches and mosques. It further stated that the sitting arrangements in mosques and churches should be done to ensure social distancing. “We also urge churches and mosques to make their services as brief as possible in order not to keep a large crowd of worshipers within an enclosed confinement for a long period of time. “The COVID-19 Squadron Committee also urges religious leaders to continue to pray for the end of the pandemic so that the world can return to normal life and activities,” the statement said. The state government in line with the federal government’s directive had placed a ban on religious congregations in the past two weeks as part of measures to stop the spread of coronavirus in the state.
