The former minister noted that Kyari leveraged on his vast experience in service to the country and humanity. “The death of Kyari came as a shock not only to me, but everyone who knew this fine gentleman as one with firm character. “I became acquainted with Kyari as the Managing Director of Geekos Security Nigerian Limited, while he was the Managing Director of UBA Plc. “His passing at a time like this has dealt a severe blow to the nation and the administration of President Buhari. “He was a key player within the administration who was renowned for his unwavering commitment to the Nigerian project. “Kyari was indeed a man of solid principles who demonstrated same by his staunch loyalty to the President and his party, the All Progressives Congress (APC). “He has left behind a vacuum that would be difficult to fill.
