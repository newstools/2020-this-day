By Hammed Shittu The Chairman of the BUA Group of Companies, Alhaji Abdulsamad Rabiu, has donated another N100 million to Kwara State’s campaign against Covid-19 pandemic. The donation came a few weeks after he donated N1 billion to some frontline states including Kwara for the same purpose. While this donation came directly to the state, the initial gesture was made through the private sector-led Coalition Against Corona Virus (CACOVID-19). This was contained in a statement issued in Ilorin on Thursday signed by Chief Press Secretary to Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrasaq and spokesman of state Covid-19, Mr. Rafiu Ajakaye. The statement said: “The new donation brings to N230m the total cash donations the state has received so far in its efforts to contain the deadly virus. “The government is particularly grateful to Alhaji AbdulSamad — and all others like him — for the generous donations which have helped in no small measure to combat the fight against the pandemic.”
