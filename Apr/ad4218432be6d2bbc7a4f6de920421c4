By Rebecca Ejifoma The Founder of Christ Mercyland Deliverance Ministry Inc. Prophet Jeremiah Fufeyin, has described the death of the late Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu Buhari, Abba Kyari, as the will of God, as he sympathises with the president, and the family of the late Kyari. Fufeyin sent his condolences via a media release he issued, Sunday, to express his immense grief for the nation’s loss over Kyari’s demise following complications from Covid-19. Known for his charitable deeds and prophesy, the cleric assured Nigerians once again that the current outbreak of Covid-19 would soon be forgotten. “It is the will of God that it happened. I commiserate with the president and the family of Kyari. My prayers is with them that God would give them the fortitude to bear the loss,” the prophet said. Fufeyin, however, recalled that last year God revealed to him this great loss being experienced by the country. “God revealed this to me last year and I shared with Strokes Africa. We prayed about it. I believe it is God’s will”, he said.
