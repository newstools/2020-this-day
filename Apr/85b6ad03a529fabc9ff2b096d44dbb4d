By Adedayo Akinwale The federal government has said that a Lebanese, Mr. Wael Jerro, who advertised a Nigeria woman for sale on Facebook has been arrested by the Lebanese government. Jerro had advertised on Facebook of his intention to sell the trafficked Nigerian woman for the sum of $1,000. This prompted the Nigeria in Diaspora Commission (NIDCOM), headed by Hon. Abike Dabiri-Erewa, to reach out to the Nigerian mission in Lebanon who reported to the host authorities. Dabiri-Erewa on Thursday announced via her twitter handle that Jerro has been arrested by the Lebanese authority. She twitted: “On Trafficked Nigerian girl for sale on Facebook by a Lebanese. The Lebanese Govt just announced the arrest of Mr. Wael Jerro for onward prosecution against criminal sales of a human, a young Nigerian girl.” The Lebanese government had on Wednesday launched a manhunt for Jerro, while the Lebanese Ministry of Labour also issued a circular on Wednesday condemning his action, describing it as completely unethical and in contravention of Lebanese laws and against the principles of human rights. The circular further stated that legal action would be constituted against him for human trafficking before the competent judicial authority by the ministry, in line with its statutory responsibility. However, the passport, which the victim acquired in May 2018, indicated that she hails from lbadan, Oyo State, while an all-out search for her is ongoing. The Nigerian mission in Lebanon has therefore demanded an immediate hand over of the victim to the mission unconditionally and in good health.
