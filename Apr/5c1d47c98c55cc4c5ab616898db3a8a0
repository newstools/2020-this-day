*To be charged to court on Wednesday By Chiemelie Ezeobi For being one of the attendees of the birthday thrown by Nollywood actress, Funke Akindele, and husband, Abdulrasheed Bello, aka JJC Skillz, former Lagos gubernatorial candidate, Babatunde Gbadamosi, and wife have turned themselves in to the police. They reported at the police station for violating the restriction order on social gathering to curtail the spread of COVID-19. The police had earlier arrested the actress and her husband and arraigned them in court on Monday. The duo pleaded guilty and were fined N100,000 each, 14 days of community services (three days in a week) and 14 days isolation. Popular musician, Azeez Fashola aka Naira Marley, who was also at the party, turned himself in Monday. When contacted, the state Police Spokesperson, DSP Bala Elkana, said contrary to claims that Gbadamosi was arrested by the police, he actually turned himself in with his wife. On whether they would be charged to court Elkana said: “The court isn’t sitting today. They missed yesterday’s window and would have to wait till tomorrow. “The restriction extends to the courts too so they don’t sit everyday in this 14-days restriction. The couple and Naira Marley would be charged to court on Wednesday.” The Lagos Infection Diseases Regulations 2020 (the Regulations) prescribes a jail term of one month or N100,000 fine or both for persons found guilty of hosting gatherings or flouting the lockdown order. The police have hinged the right to arrest/detain anyone who breaks this rule on this regulation.
