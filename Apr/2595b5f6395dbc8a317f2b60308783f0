By Chinedu Eze In continuation of the evacuation exercise occasioned by the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, South African Airways yesterday airlifted 136 of the countryâ€™ citizens out of Nigeria from the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA), Lagos. The South Africa Airways aircraft with the registration mark: ZS-SNB, operated by Airbus A346, departed yesterday evening to Johannesburg. The aircraft, which earlier arrived in the country at 3:10 p.m. local time, departed 7:00 p.m. It was the first time any African country would be evacuating its citizens from Nigeria since the spread of COVID-19, which occasioned global lockdown. South Africa was one of the few countries that first evacuated its citizens from China, where the pandemic first broke out.
