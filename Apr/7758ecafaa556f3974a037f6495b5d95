The United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has warned that the world faces the most challenging crisis since World War II, as COVID-19 pandemic continues to sweep across continents. Stating this during the launch of a report on the Socioeconomic Impacts of COVID-19 yesterday, he said the looming devastation from the pandemic could bring recession that may have no parallel in the recent past. He said: “There is also a risk that the combination of the disease and its economic impact will contribute to enhanced instability, enhanced unrest, and enhanced conflict. “I am calling for a much stronger and more effective global response to the coronavirus pandemic and to the social and economic devastation that COVID-19 is causing.”
