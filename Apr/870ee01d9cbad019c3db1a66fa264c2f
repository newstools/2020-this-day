Prince and Princess Estate, Duboyi, Abuja yesterday received medical supplies from Mr. Tony Afechukwu, Dr. Eric Nwanze, Dr. Charles Agadu and other kind- hearted residents as part of efforts to curb the spread of coronavirus in Nigeria. Speaking at the commissioning of the Hand-wash equipment, Sanitizer closets among other items made accessible for the residents at the two main entrance gates, the Chairman of the Estate Residents Association, Mr. Victor Adoga, commended the philanthropic gestures of members of the Estate and the COVID-19 Response team, especially at this crisis time. Adoga said the medical supplies, donated to the estate by Ifechukwu to prevent the spread of COVID-19, would be located at the two entrance gates of the estate with effect from yesterday. While calling on Nigerians in whatever capacity they are to make sacrifice in this period of health challenge, the chairman said the initiative was indeed a laudable one which erases all doubts that, Nigerians can be united as a people in their bid to confront an existential threat as being demonstrated at Prince and Princess Estate. He said: “Every resident of Prince and Princess Estate should be proud of this day as we take the lead in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. “This is not the first time man is faced with existential threats and pandemic of this nature but we have always triumphed and by God’s grace we shall triumph against COVID-19”.
