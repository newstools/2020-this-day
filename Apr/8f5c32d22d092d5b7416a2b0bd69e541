Federal government has stated that the Lagos-Ibadan standard gauge rail project is 90 per cent complete. Outgoing Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Transportation, Mr. Sabiu Zakari, said this at the ministryâ€™s headquarters in Abuja yesterday, while handing over to a new Permanent Secretary, Mr. Hussaini Adamu. Presenting his stewardship at the ministry, Zakari expressed happiness that it was during his tenure that cardinal projects such as Abuja-Kaduna light rail train service was completed and put to use. Zakari, in a statement issued by the ministry, stated that the Lagos-Ibadan standard gauge railway was 90 per cent completed, adding that what remained was the point linking the rail line to Apapa ports. He said the Itakpe-Warri rail line, which was abandoned for over 30 years, was completed while he worked at the ministry, adding that test runs were currently ongoing on the facility.
