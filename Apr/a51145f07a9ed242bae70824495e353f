Segun Awofadeji in Gombe Gombe State Government is ready to produce over one million units of face masks for distribution to the people across the state, especially the less privileged as part of measures to curtail the spread of COVID-19. This was disclosed by the Chairman of the state Task Force on COVID-19, Professor Idris Mohammed, Wednesday while receiving a donation of locally made supporting items from the state office of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC). He said plans were underway to make it mandatory for everyone to put on the face mask but that his committee would ensure that the items are made available before the policy takes effect. The task force chairman said already the face masks were being produced and would be made available as soon as they are ready in a couple of weeks. He appreciated the NYSC for identifying with the state government at this trying time, adding that the gesture will significantly help the state government in attaining its plan of reaching every household with face masks and hand wash items. The NYSC state Coordinator, Florence Yaakugh, while presenting the items, said the corps members in the state have benefitted much from the state government as such, the state deserves much from the NYSC, especially at this trying time when the world is engaged in the fight against the deadly virus.
