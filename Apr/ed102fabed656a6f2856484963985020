Owoeye held that Muslims should heed Allah’s commandment which directed them to freely give of what they have to those in need.The Speaker in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Kunle Alabi said this act of giving would help the less-privileged in the society and reduce hunger and misery engendered by the lockdown to contain the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. He also stated that as a nation, what the people, leaders and followers needed to do in time like this was to come together and forge a harmonious relationship to fight the community transmission of Coronavirus. The Speaker admonished that Ramadan’s evening prayers could be performed at home if it could not be done at mosques due to the precautionary measures taken by government against the spread of the virus. According to him, “We should at this period of Ramadan heed the commandment of Allah and let the significance of the holy month reflect in our relationship with one another, we should give special consideration to the needy and the poor by providing for them, by so doing, we will be cushioning the effect of the pandemic. “It is not in doubt that this year’s Ramadan will be more subdued than usual, Muslims must have to balance the need to worship with the social distancing and stay at home orders that governments have imposed because of coronavirus pandemic. “I want to implore us all to support government to contain the community transmission of COVID-19 by ensuring that all laid down measures are adhered to. With our prayers in time like this, our nation and world shall be healed”. The Speaker emphasised
