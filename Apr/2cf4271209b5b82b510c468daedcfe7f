Twenty Kumo East ward executives of the All Progressives Congress in Gombe State have distanced themselves from the reported dismissal of the member representing Akko Federal Constituency at the House of Representatives Usman Bello Kumo from the party, by the ward chairman Musa Barade among other six executives, stressing that they were not aware of the illegal move. APC Secretary Kumo East, Shu’aibu Adamu, made this known on Thursday during a press briefing organized by the ward executives at the state party secretariat Gombe. Adamu said “Some unscrupulous elements in the party forged our signatures and purportedly expelled Usman Bello Kumo from the party. This was done without our knowledge.” The secretary added that “for this damage of reputation and credibility, we therefore suspend Barade as APC chairman Kumo East ward for six months with effect from today, 2nd of April, 2020.” He said their support remains with Kumo as member representing Akko Federal constituency and were satisfied with his style of representation. He called on the public to disregard any report on expulsion of Kumo from the party, describing it as baseless and untrue. Similarly Akko Local Government APC chairman said some unscrupulous elements were trying to cause harvoc in the party, adding they were ready to deal with them. Ahmad Kumo added that their loyalty remains with the state party leader, Governor Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya.
