Vice President Yemi Osinbajo yesterday met with representatives of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank as Nigeria continues to improve on its economic stimulus packages for citizens. President Muhammadu Buhari had asked the Vice President to chair the Economic Sustainability Committee (ESC) and the committee has been collaborating with domestic sectors of the Nigerian economy. Osinbajo is also interfacing with international agencies for the purpose of rolling out options as the President has directed. In a tweet by the spokesperson to the Vice President, Mr. Laolu Akande, the meeting with the agencies ended yesterday afternoon. “Osinbajo has been busy today holding video conference-based meetings with IMF and World Bank representatives on how the agencies can collaborate with President Buhari’s forthcoming additional economic stimulus packages. “Video shows just concluded meeting with World Bank Nigeria representatives,” he tweeted. The Economic Sustainability Committee is a seven-member team chaired by Osinbajo, and the Committee is expected to conclude its report very soon. It was set up as a response to the recent challenges in the economic front resulting from the fall in the prices of oil in the international market as well as the disruptive impact of the pandemic that has disrupted the global economy.
