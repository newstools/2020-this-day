Leading telecommunications service provider, Airtel Nigeria, has entered a partnership with leading education technology company, uLesson to subsidize online education for uLesson app users during the covid-19 stay at home period. The partnership provides all new and existing uLesson subscribers who use the Airtel network, free 500MB daily to continue learning via the uLesson app. According to the Chief Executive Officer, uLesson, Sim Shagaya, the partnership is in line with uLesson’s mission to help students be the very best they can be and prepare them for a future in various disciplines. “We designed the uLesson app to enable students to have access to high-quality, affordable and accessible education, helping them maximise their academic achievement” he said. Shagaya further explained, “Beyond providing an opportunity for more students to use a platform that enables them to study in a simplified and easy manner, this partnership further bridges the education gap that has resulted from the current health crisis by creating a fully integrated data-free learning solution”. Commenting on Airtel Nigeria’s partnership with uLesson, Chief Commercial Officer, Airtel Nigeria, Dinesh Balsingh said, “Airtel Nigeria is passionate about Nigerian youth and committed to doing whatever is required to flatten the covid-19 curve. As a key stakeholder in the Nigerian project, we are pleased to partner with uLesson to connect young Nigerians to platforms that will empower them to become successful and also realize their full potential”. uLesson had in previous weeks announced a reduction in prices of its product offerings to enable more students to learn at home. The Company introduced a 5000-naira stream-only access to the full senior secondary school library for one term (ending August 31st), and the N29,500 package which comes with the pack (dongle and SD card) was also reduced to N24,500; all in a bid to ease the disruption resulting from necessary school closures”.
