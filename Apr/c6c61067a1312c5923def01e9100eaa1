Thirty-one COVID-19 patients in Ghana have been discharged after recovering from the disease. The country’s Minister of Health, Kwaku Agyemang, broke the news during an interview with journalists yesterday. The country has confirmed 161 cases, of which five deaths have been recorded. Agyemang said the 31 recovered patients would be monitored closely in their respective homes. This is the highest number of patients who have recovered on the continent so far. “We have conducted some tests and 31 persons out of the total active cases have not shown symptoms,” he said. “I keep on emphasising that the fatality rate in Ghana is very low so Ghanaians should not be scared. The five persons who have already lost their lives had underlying medical conditions.” Globally, over 830,000 coronavirus cases have been confirmed, according to Worldometer, a website which provides real-time updates on the virus situation globally. At least 176,000 people have recovered while over 41,000 people have died from the disease.
