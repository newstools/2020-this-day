By Martins Ifijeh Following concerns expressed by residents of Rivers State over concession granted churches to hold Easter services, the state government has reversed the decision, saying restrictions continue during Easter. Announcing this Saturday, the Commissioner for Information, Rivers State, Paulinus Nsirim, said Governor Nyesom Wike took the decision after due consultations with eminent clergymen, well-meaning Nigerians and civil society groups. He said: “For the avoidance of doubt, churches should stick to the 50 persons per service to maintain social distancing.”
