Group Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of Access Bank Plc, Mr. Herbert Wigwe, had said last month said the bank completed the merger and business combination of the erstwhile Diamond Bank making it the biggest bank in Nigeria by total assets and number of customers as well as a significant retail footprint and infrastructure. According to him, the business combination allowed them complement their existing strong wholesale business with Diamond’s extremely developed retail business. He had added that the bank intended to carry on the positive momentum from 2019 and invest in digital solutions including Artifcial Intelligence and advance analytics. “Our resolve is to ensure that our customers have best in speed, service and security. We projected merger synergies of N153.9 billion (cost and revenue) over three years. Thus far, we have recorded synergies totalling N42.8 million in nine months, of which N28.8 million is recoveries. In 2020, we expect to realise significant cost synergies, which will substantially cut down our cost and boost profitability. Being a systemically important Nigerian bank, we are aware that sustainable returns can only come from a sustainable and resilient business model. As such, our intent to embed resilience at the core of our financing activity is further strengthened, as we journey together to building a bank that is more than banking,” Wigwe said.
