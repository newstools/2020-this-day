Martins Ifijeh The Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has recommended face masks for Nigerians as part of its new guidelines for halting the community spread of COVID-19. In its latest advisory released Tuesday, the Centre said this should serve as an added layer of physical distancing, and that they should be disposed of properly after use. The advisory reads in part: “Masks should be used while in crowded settings, like markets. They should be used in combination with social distancing, hand washing, respiratory hygiene and disinfection of surfaces. “It is critical to ensure proper handling of masks. Improper disposal and frequent touching can increase risk of infection with the COVID-19 virus.” It however stressed that due to a global shortage of face masks, medical masks were best preserved for patients and healthcare workers who need them most. It added that people should make use of improvised options such as cloth masks. “Improvised face masks can be used as long as they are properly washed regularly. They can be made out of cloth or other materials,” the advisory said.
