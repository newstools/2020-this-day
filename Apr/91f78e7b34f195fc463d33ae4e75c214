By Onyebuchi Ezigbo The President of the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA), Dr. Francis Adedayo Faduyile, has urged the government to ensure good working environment for all categories of health workers in the country. In a goodwill message to nurses and midwives in the country to mark this year’s World Health Day, Faduyile said nurses and midwives who most often work under intense pressure, high workload and very inhumane conditions, especially in fragile health systems should be taken care of. “We also note with particular concern hazards all healthcare professionals, including nurses working at the frontlines of the war against COVID-19 face continually. It is our prayer that those in authority will do all it takes to ensure a healthy working environment that is ennobling and dignifying,” he said. This year’s world health day was dedicated to members of the nursing and midwifery profession by the World Health Organisation (WHO) with the theme: “Support Nurses and Midwives”. “As the World Health Organisation (WHO) celebrates the Nursing profession by making the theme of the 2020 World Health Day to be “Support Nurses and Midwives”, the NMA acknowledges the enormous contributions of our nurses and midwives in the health sector and the country,” he said. The NMA president said that the circumstances in which the nurses and midwives operate may expose them to dangerous health risks and even death while saving other lives. “We, in the NMA, have opened another chapter of warmer relationship based on mutual respect and acknowledgement of our different but inter-dependent roles in the health sector. We pledge to continue on this path for better patient outcomes and the good of our country, ” he said
