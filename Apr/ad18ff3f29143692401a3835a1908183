John Shiklam in Kaduna Kaduna State Government has temporarily relaxed the restriction of movement imposed throughout the state to check the spread of COVID-19. The state Deputy Governor, Dr. Hadiza Balarabe, who announced this in a statewide broadcast yesterday, said the curfew would be eased from 3 p.m. on Wednesday to 12 midnight on Thursday. She said the decision to relax the curfew “is to enable people to stock up foods and other essentials in their house. ‘’Subsequently, the restriction of movement will be lifted every Tuesday and Wednesday. Traders in food and other essentials will open their shops on these two days.” The deputy governor apologised for the inconvenience the restriction of movement has caused, stressing that the decision was taken because of the extraordinary situation caused by COVID-19 pandemic. She appealed to the people of the state to ensure the observance of social distancing, avoid crowded places and wash their hands regularly. The state government had on Thursday last week imposed a 24-hour curfew to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Residents of the state had been groaning under serious difficulties as a result of shortage of food and other essential commodities following the curfew. There had been agitation by members of the public for the curfew to be relaxed.
