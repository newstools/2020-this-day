By Deji Elumoye The Yoruba socio-cultural group, Afenifere, has warned Governor Rotimi Akeredolu, not to succumb to any blackmail by christian religious leaders over the conduct of Easter service in the state. Its spokesman, Yinka Odumakin, in a one-page statement entitled “Akeredolu Must Resist Easter Blackmail” issued on Thursday, said the group has it on good authority that Governor Akeredolu has approved the conduct of Easter Servce in Ondo State churches after a meeting with the state chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN). According to him, Afenifere sees this as succumbing to blackmail from religious leaders who should know better.
“We are of the view that the religious leaders on their own shouid have cancelled Easter Service on their own at a time that even the Pope is holding online service on palm Sunday. “Since it now appears they are the ones putting pressure on the Governor to put the health of the people in jeopardy, we call on Arakunrin Akeredolu to lead them and not to allow them to mislead him.. “We were miffed when we heard that Katsina was going to allow Jumat Service on Friday in jeopardy of public health but did not think similar thing would happen in our backyard. “Mr Governor, kindly reconsider the decision. To all Christians in the state, we say: you will celebrate many Easters inside church if Jesus tarries but do everything to keep yourselves alive from this pandemic currently ravaging,” Odumakin said.
