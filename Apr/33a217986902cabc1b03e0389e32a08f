By Chris Uba In furtherance of efforts at tackling the coronavirus pandemic in Nigeria, the Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) has undertaken a quality assurance inspection of Cross River Garment Factory (CRGF) in Calabar, Cross River State. Located at Atimbo, by Goodluck Jonathan Bypass, Calabar, the factory is into mass production of Ankara barrier masks in furtherance of the “No Masks, No Movement” policy of the state government. The SON inspection team was led by the state coordinator, Michael Ogbuji, accompanied by Mrs. Bassey Duke and Samson Kolaru. Welcoming the team, Acting Managing Director of CRGF, Edet Joseph described the factory’s product as double layer composite Masks with inner liner and high tensile strength of the head harness as well as neat sowing finishes. According to him, the ankara material being used for the barrier masks is 100 per cent cotton and sourced from neighbouring Abia State. The acting MD stated that all precautionary safety measures were being observed in the mass production of the re-usable masks with capacity for 100,000 units per day. It can be used for a maximum of four weeks, he said.
