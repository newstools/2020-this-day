Chuks Okocha in Abuja National Working Committee (NWC) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday approved the reconstitution of the current PDP Ondo State exco into the state caretaker committee with effect from April 5, 2020 when its tenure is due to expire. NWC’s decision is predicated on the party’s inability to conduct the state congress scheduled for March 24, 2020 due to the outbreak of COVID-19 leading to the stay-at-home and social distancing directives issued by the federal government to curtail the spread of the virus. According to the party’s National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan: “By the approval of the NWC, the state exco is empowered to act as a state caretaker committee until such a time that it is possible for the conduct of the state congress for the election of state officials, provided that they shall not serve in such capacity for more than three months from April 5, 2020”. Furthermore, the NWC said that it has approved the ward and Local Government Congresses and consequently affirmed all the elected executive committee members of the party at those chapters in the state. It directed the Ondo State PDP Chairman, to inaugurate the elected ward and Local Government executive committee members, whose tenure in office, pursuant to in pursuant to Section 47(1) of the PDP Constitution 2017 (as emended), shall be from March 30, 2020 to March 30 2024 for the ward executives and April 2, 2020 to April 2, 2024 for LG executives respectively.
