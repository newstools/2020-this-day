Rebecca Ejifoma Nurses from the Enugu State University Teaching Hospital (ESUTH) have protested the lack of personnel protective equipment in hospitals across Enugu State following the outbreak of COVID-19. A viral video on social media Wednesday showed the nurses dressed in white protesting on the streets chanting, “No working material for us”. Reacting to their public demonstration, the management of Enugu State University Teaching Hospital, Parklane Enugu in conjunction with the leadership of the nurses of the same institution regretted the action in a statement it issued Wednesday. The statement had signatories including: the Chief Medical Director, Prof. Hyacinth E. Onah; Dr. Ogechukwu F. Amadi (CMAC); Comrade Innocent Ezema (Chairman ANNM); Mrs. Chinawa Fidelia (HNS ESUTH); and the Chairman TUC Enugu State, Comrade Ben Asoswa. “The institute’s management regret what happened today regarding nurses who were demonstrating. These nurses were a few who were apprehensive of their front-line status in the Management of COVID-19 pandemic,” the management noted. According to the Enugu State Multi-Sectoral Response Team, NCDC, WHO, UNICEF and other development partners and philanthropists have provided enough quantities of those materials for which the nurses were demonstrating. The management assured the public that “The hospital will continue to render health services at the highest level of care as has been the use”.
