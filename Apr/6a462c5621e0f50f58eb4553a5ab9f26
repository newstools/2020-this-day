By Tosin Clegg MultiChoice Nigeria has announced a number of initiatives to support the federal and Lagos State governments in ameliorating the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak in the country. The leading entertainment and media company’s contribution in the fight against Covid-19 includes cash support of N200 million and N50 million to the federal and Lagos State governments, respectively. There was also the donation of 10,000 certified test kits to the NCDC, public service announcement on Covid-19 prevention tips in English, Pidgin, Ibo, Yoruba and Hausa languages. Notably, is the approved inventory worth over N550 million highlighting the NCDC’s Covid-19 Helplines and PSAs on more than 10 channels across DStv and GOtv. The company will also cover the remuneration of engaged creative industry professionals whose productions have been disrupted, with a committed sum of up to N400 million. As seen in the most hard-hit countries, the availability of test kits and supplies for medical personnel have been some of the biggest challenges in fighting the pandemic. The outbreak has also had a direct impact on individual businesses and general economic activities. Nigeria’s creative industry has been particularly affected, with ongoing productions suspended in response to government’s advisory on public gatherings and social distancing. MultiChoice Nigeria’s intervention, in line with its values as a responsible corporate organisation and leader in the media and creative sector, is aimed at supporting the authorities in fighting the pandemic and reducing its attendant impact on Nigeria’s economy.
