Industry association the GSMA pulled the plug on MWC Shanghai 2020, cancelling its second major event of the year due to concerns about Coronavirus (Covid-19). The event was originally scheduled to run from June 30 through July 2, with more than 75,000 attendees and over 500 exhibitors expected. In lieu of the main event, the GSMA said it planned to work with government and health officials to identify suitable dates and venues to hold regional conferences in China in the second half of 2020. It added it would confirm the feasibility of these plans in the coming months. “We look forward to continuing to engage in the region throughout the year and in the build-up to MWC Shanghai 2021,” GSMA said in a statement. The move comes after the GSMA in February was forced to cancel MWC Barcelona, Spain 2020, as the spread of Covid-19 made it impossible to hold the event as planned. It later offered a compensation package for exhibitors which had signed up for the event, and signed a contract with local partners ensuring MWC will be held in Barcelona at least until 2024. Plans for the third event in the MWC 2020 series, MWC Los Angeles in October, remain unchanged, GSMA said.
