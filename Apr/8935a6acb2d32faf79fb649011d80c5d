Online retail store, Jumia, has devised a new means of delivering goods to its customers without flouting the federal government order for safety and social distancing amid Corona virus pandemic. The firm stated that it had decided to initiate a ‘contactless’ delivery strategy not only to protect its customers but also delivery agents and partners. It noted that the delivery option was only open to prepaid packages on its platform. Speaking on this innovative move, SVP Logistics at Jumia, Apoorva Kumar, stated that it was an additional measure to keep consumers, delivery agents and partners safe in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak. He said, “The health and safety of our customers and delivery agents is our absolute priority. We are uniquely positioned to step up and be part of Africa’s response strategy in this challenging time. “We have implemented a “Contactless” delivery option, which eliminates any possibility of physical contact. Convenience, social distancing and cashless measures are woven into one solution to combat the current situation.” He added that the delivery agents had been trained to enforce necessary standards during delivery. “They are instructed to call or text when they arrive at the customer’s place and drop off the package at their doorstep, then step back to the safe distance limit while they wait for the customer to take the package before leaving. “Consumers are strongly encouraged to pay “cashless” on Jumia through JumiaPay. This will ensure less physical cash coming into contact with delivery riders and the wider population and will in turn help reduce the risk of coronavirus transmission.”
