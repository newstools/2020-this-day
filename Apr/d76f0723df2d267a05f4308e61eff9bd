Yinka Kolawole in Osogbo As part of the rigid steps to ensure total compliance with its lockdown directive imposed on the state to curb the spread of COVID-19, the Osun State Government has mounted barricades at all boundaries leading into the state and on major roads within the state. This follows the announcement that the 14-day lockdown in the state was not a curfew, but a total lockdown with no human and vehicular movements in the state. The state Commissioner for Information and Civic Orientation, Mrs. Funke Egbemode, during an interview with journalists yesterday, said the barricades were erected to throttle back unauthorised movements across the state. She stated further that the state government was intensifying efforts to flatten the curve of COVID-19 in the state and avoid a resurgence of the disease. Egbemode added: “the state government is determined to protect its citizens, hence, this move by the government is to keep defiant people from hurting themselves and endangering others. “The barricades will only be opened to essential duty vehicles conveying materials needed for the fight against COVID-19. Non-essential travels and movements remain banned in the state till further notice.” Corroborating Egbemode, the state Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Hon. Adeleke Yekini Adebayo, who also doubles as a member of the state COVID-19 Task Force, noted that the government installed physical barricades at its boundaries to ensure safety of its citizens, stressing that the action was to prevent human and vehicular movements from neighboring states with increasing number of COVID-19 cases.
