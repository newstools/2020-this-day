I woke up last Friday to receive the sad news that Mallam Abba Kyari, the Chief of Staff to President Muhammad Buhari, is dead due to COVID-19 complications. I knew that from the last statement he made and released to the media that he was attacked by Coronavirus and is advised to seek appropriate medical attention. I never imagined or thought it would come to this tragic end. I just kept praying and hoping that he would get well very soon. I have known Abba Kyari as a stable and reliable man for many years. He was an exemplary student at Warwick and Cambridge Universities in the United Kingdom and the Law School in Lagos. Abba Kyari was a highly intelligent, focused and honest student who studied Law and Sociology. I have also followed his impressive working career in law, media and the banking sectors. From the time of his appointment as Chief of Staff to President Buhari in 2015, I have watched him and I can say that his loyalty to his principal and the government was unflinching and commendable without doubt. I pray that God rewards his efforts and the sacrifices he made while serving the President, the government and our country.
I pray that God gives the President the fortitude to bear the loss of a friend, a comrade and a loyal public servant who was very dedicated to him and his government. I also pray that God will shower His Mercies on Abba and forgive him. May the Almighty Allah give his family the fortitude to bear this great loss. Amin. â€¢General Babangida, a former military president, writes from Minna, Niger State
