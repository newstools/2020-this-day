By Emma Okonji Galaxy Backbone, an organisation under the Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy, has assured all government agencies of high level connectivity that will give their workers uninterrupted access to their offices and hubs, while working from home during the lockdown period. In a statement released by Galaxy Backbone, the agency said it had set up a team made up of senior management staff, Network Engineers, System Administrators and Customer Operations Executives, including its Covid-19 Action Team, to ensure seamless connectivity across all government agencies and private organisations that are connected to the hub of Galaxy Backbone. According to the statement, the main objective is to ensure the continuity of government operations through the provision and implementation of video conferencing, Internet Protocol (IP) Phones and other communication services to the members of Presidential Taskforce Committee, Office of the Vice President, Ministers, Permanent Secretaries of Federal Ministries, Security Operatives, Federal Ministry of Health, the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and other public sector essential service providers. Managing Director/Chief Executive of Galaxy Backbone, Prof. Muhammad Abubakar, said several successes had been recorded through the initiative, which he explained, had enhanced the operations of government officials during the COVID-19 period. According to him, over 150 Unified Communication devices, from video conferencing terminals to vdeo phones, have been installed in the offices and residences of top government officials. Abubakar noted that these services had recently enabled the executive officers of the government to communicate among themselves while maintaining the principles of social distancing. “We have deployed video conferencing facilities and IP telephony to the state house to enable effective communication and possible online meetings of President Muhammadu Buhari and members of the Presidential Task Force on COVID -19, Ministers, top government officials and other NEC members,” Abubakar said. All our personnel at the frontline will continue to adhere strictly to all the guidelines set by the NCDC, Federal Ministry of Health and the World Health Organisation (WHO) as it discharges its essential services.
