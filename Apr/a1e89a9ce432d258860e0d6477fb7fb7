Wapic Insurance Plc, one of Nigeria’s leading underwriters, has become the first Nigerian motor insurer to offer customers refunds on their insurance premiums. This act of empathy is made in line with Wapic’s understanding that most drivers are stuck at home and unable to drive their motor vehicles in line with the COVID-19 pandemic stay at home policy. Beyond financial and other contributions the company is making to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, Wapic is serious about supporting its customers, particularly the most vulnerable, during this difficult time. The insurer takes pride in always putting customers first and continually improving its services to deliver a unique and excellent customer experience. Wapic’s outgoing Chairman, Mr. Aigboje Aig-Imoukhuede advised: “We know that our customers are experiencing unprecedented circumstances and many are struggling to cope. We want to recognise the sacrifice you are making by driving significantly less as you support our country’s objectives in flattening the curve of the pandemic. We want our customers to know they can Rest Assured and we will defeat this pandemic together.” Wapic is passing the benefit of reduced motor insurance claims during this period onto our existing policy holders. T he refund will automatically be credited to customers with active policies at the end of the lockdown period.
