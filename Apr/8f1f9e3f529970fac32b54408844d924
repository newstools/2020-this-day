Deji Elumoye in Abuja A member of the National Assembly, Senator Olamilekan Adeola, has made a N50 million cash donation to cushion the effect of the dreaded COVID-19 pandemic on members of his constituents in Lagos West senatorial district. Adeola, a ranking senator and Chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance, said the donation would go to 15,000 persons identified in his constituency as part of relief measures in the face of the ravaging COVID-19 pandemic. Adeola said: “In addition to all measures taken by the National Assembly as donation and palliative towards the fight against COVID-19, I deem it fit to go a step further in view of the huge population of the District and the many poor and vulnerable constituents and I urge constituents to see the donation as my contribution to lessen the inconveniences of the lockdown with a view to return of normalcy soon.” The donation would be distributed across the 10 Local Government Areas (LGAs) and 18 Local Council Development Areas (LCDAs) in the senatorial zone. Adeola stressed that the gesture would complement the effort of Lagos State Government under Govenor Babajide Sanwo-Olu in ameliorating the hardship and inconveniences of the COVID- 19 lockdown on the residents of the state. He advised that as much as possible Lagosians should abide by all precautionary measures rolled out by the government to contain and eliminate the pandemic. He also set up a six-man committee that would implement the cash disbursement targeted in the first instance at 15,000 vulnerable individuals, families and groups with beneficiaries getting sums ranging from a minimum of N2,500 and a maximum of N250,000 for groups based on needs. Senator Adeola reiterated that the ugly incident of COVID-19 and its trajectory in Nigeria has further reinforced the call on the federal government to grant Lagos State a special status and funding in view of its population. He said that such gesture would serve the country’s national interest, a point the fight against COVID-19 has proved clearly.
