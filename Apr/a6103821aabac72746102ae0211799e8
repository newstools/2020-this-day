Former Barcelona forward Samuel Eto’o is doing his bit to tackle the coronavirus, promising supplies to 100,000 people in his home country of Cameroon.The retired 39-year-old will donate face masks, hand sanitisers, soaps and food through his Samuel Eto’o foundation. The vital supplies will be sent to 50,000 households across four cities in the African nation – Douala, Buea, Yaoundé and Bafoussam. Additionally, 50,000 face masks will be provided for taxi drivers who are at increased risk of catching the disease. A statement from the foundation read: ‘This is a serious humanitarian crisis and only via proper sanitisation and the distribution of health kits can we curb the coronavirus.’ All sporting activities have been suspended in Cameroon while the country deals with the virus, and its borders have been closed. Eto’o picked up 118 caps for Cameroon, scoring 56 times and featuring at four World Cups. He last played professionally for Qatar SC in the 2018-19 season for one season before calling time on his 22-year football career. At the peak of his powers he was considered as one of the best forwards in the word, as he won back-to-back Champions League titles with Barcelona and Inter Milan ten years ago. He started his career with Real Madrid and played in the Premier League towards the end of his career with Chelsea and Everton.
