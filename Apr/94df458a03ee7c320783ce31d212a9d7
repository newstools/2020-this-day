All Progressives Congress National Leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, has congratulated the party’s National Chairman, Comrade Adams Aliu Oshiomhole, as he turns 68 on April 4. He said Oshiomhole still has a lot to contribute to the party and Nigeria. In a special congratulatory message to the APC chairman released by his Media Office and signed by Tunde Rahman, Asiwaju Tinubu said Oshiomhole had contributed immensely to the country. He said; “As a veteran labour leader, two-time governor of Edo State, progressive ally and politician of remarkable acumen, you have come a long way and contributed immensely to our party and our country. “A tireless campaigner and adept mobiliser, you steered our party through the landslide re-election of President Muhammadu Buhari and victory for APC candidates in the 2019 national and states elections. “You still have much to contribute to our party and country. My prayer is that God grant you more years, robust health and continued energy as you serve our party and our nation in the pursuit and development of progressive good governance for all people.”
