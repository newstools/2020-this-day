By Goddy Egene Profit-taking in bellwethers such as Dangote Cement Plc, Nestle Nigeria Plc and some banking stocks halted the equities market’s further recovery last week. The market had jumped 7.19 per cent the previous week, recovering about N801.3 billion in value due to bargain hunting by investors. However, the trend changed last week as investors locked in profits recorded during the short bull-run. As a result, the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) All-Share Index (ASI) fell 1.4 per cent to close lower at 22,921.38, while market capitalisation shed N167.9 billion to close at N11.778 trillion. Although there were positive performances on two trading sessions, decline for three days led to the negative close. Investors’ sentiments were still being influenced by the impact of the coronavirus in Nigeria that has continued to spread. Globally, COVID-19 continued to spread, with the total number of cases reaching about 2.7 million at the weekend, up from the 1.9 million recorded the previous week while the death toll rose to 191,167 from 130,885 persons. Unfortunately, optimism about a potential vaccine was dashed as Gilead’s ‘Remdesivir’ failed the first clinical trial. According to Afrinvest, the United States remains the hardest hit with active cases and death toll totaling 888,709 and 50,243 respectively. “Similarly, an additional 4.4 million people filed unemployment claims, taking total Coronavirus-induced job losses to 26.5 million (16 per cent unemployment rate). The US Senate has approved a Coronavirus Relief Bill of $484 billion to provide new funding for distressed small businesses, with readiness to deploy more relief packages. In the coming week, we expect concerns on the spread of the virus to shape investor sentiments in the markets,” Afrinvest said.
