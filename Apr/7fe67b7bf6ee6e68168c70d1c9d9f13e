Chuks Okocha in Abuja A former President of the Senate, Senator David Mark, has urged Nigerians to join forces with state and federal governments in the battle against the dreaded disease code named COVID-19. Mark said the unabated spread of the virus reinforced the urgent need for all citizens to comply with the stay-at-home order and the observation of personal hygiene, regular washing of hands and the application of hand sanitiser to curtail the spread. A statement signed by the Media Adviser to Senator David Mark, Mr. Paul Mumeh, said the lockdown in some parts of the country was one of the measures needed to contain the scourge. Mark, therefore, urged Nigerians to accept the discomfort and cooperate with authorities in order to curtail and ultimately terminate the virus. The former Senate President also urged the federal government to work out modalities toward distributing palliatives to Nigerians in order to ameliorate the pains of the lockdown like it is done in other countries affected by the pandemic. He, however, enjoined authorities especially the law enforcement agencies, to apply the internationally accepted standards of enforcement by respecting the human rights procedures, the rule of law and operating with human face. He said: “It is necessary to observe all safety measures on both sides so that we would not unwittingly create more problems. After all, the whole essence is the safety of all.” He also reminded those in authority that the primary objective of government is the welfare and security of the citizens, which he described as the sacred covenant government had with the people. Mark noted that the scourge would be surmountable if Nigerians would comply with the preventive measures without minding their discomfort.
