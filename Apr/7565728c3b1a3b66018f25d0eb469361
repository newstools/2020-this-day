The Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, Tuesday said his ministry had set up a ministerial expert advisory committee, headed by a prominent virologist, to study the evolution and development of the COVID-19 outbreak and the responses in Nigeria. Speaking Tuesday at the daily press briefing on COVID-19, he said the team would also advise on the national strategy and action plan, using lessons learned across the globe. “This will help us to identify and adopt the promising strategies and align our plans with best practices and advisories,” he said. Ehanire added that there’s a national concern about the sharp increase of COVID-19 cases in Kano, concentrated in seven municipal council areas and also about certain so-called “unexplained” deaths. He said his ministry had sent a nine-man delegation to Kano on a fact-finding mission and to support the COVID-19 response in the state.
