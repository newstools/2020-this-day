Igbawase Ukumba in Lafia The police authorities in Nasarawa State thursday said it had recovered the sum of N1,163, 500 from suspected kidnappers of the Special Adviser to the state Governor, Abdullahi Sule, on Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, John Mamman. The state Police Commissioner, Bola Longe, disclosed this when he interacted with journalists in his office in Lafia, adding that the police also arrested 10 suspects in connection with the kidnap of the Special Adviser and recovered assorted mobile phones. Mamman was kidnapped last Saturday night at about 8 p.m. in his house at Dari village of Kokona Local Government Area of the state by gunmen. This was even as Longe said the police have as well rescued the Special Adviser unhurt in Gudi area of Akwanga LGA of the state from the kidnappers. He told journalists that after getting information about the kidnap of the Governor’s aide, the state police command swung into action by deploying 16 cracked personnel to Gudi area where intelligence indicated that the kidnappers were with the victim in the bush. According to Longe, “In the process, seven suspects were arrested behind the Government Secondary School, Gudi. That arrest must have created pressure on the kidnappers who eventually released their victim, Mamman, last Tuesday. “Also intelligence report had it that some of the kidnappers were around Doma area. Police went there, engaged them and arrested two out of which one was severely wounded during a gun duel with the police while others escaped.” The police commissioner gave details that one suspect was arrested on the day of the incident; seven others arrested the following day, while two were equally nabbed last Wednesday.
