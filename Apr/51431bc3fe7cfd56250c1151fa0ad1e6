By John Shiklam The Kaduna State Government has temporarily relaxed the restriction of movement which was imposed throughout the state to check the spread of COVID-19. The Deputy Governor, Dr. Hadiza Balarabe, who announced this in a statewide broadcast on Wednesday, said the curfew will be eased from 3:00pm on Wednesday to 12 midnight on Thursday. She said the decision to relax the curfew “is to enable people to stock up on food and other essentials’’. ‘’Subsequently, the restriction of movement will be lifted every Tuesday and Wednesday. Traders in food and other essentials will open their shops on these two days,” she said. She apologised for the inconvenience that the restriction of movement has caused, stressing that the decision was taken because of the extraordinary times which was brought about by COVID-19. The deputy governor appealed to the people of the state to ensure the observance of social distancing, avoid crowded places and to wash their hands regularly. The state government had on Thursday last week imposed a 24-hour curfew to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Residents of the state had been groaning under serious difficulties as a result of the shortage of food items and essential commodities following the curfew. There had been agitation by members of the public for the curfew to be relaxed.
