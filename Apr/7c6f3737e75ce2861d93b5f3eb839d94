He was one of those who pioneered celebrity journalism in the country. “As a social commentator, he has helped the course of good governance and positively impacted public issues and policies. “With his rich political pedigree, Akinpelu is himself a progressive politician and a collaborator who brings in tremendous value. “As he joins the Sexagenarian Club, I pray that Almighty Allah grant him many more years, robust health and the required energy to continue to contribute positively towards the advancement of good governance and equitable society.”
