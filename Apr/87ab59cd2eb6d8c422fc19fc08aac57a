Ethiopian Airlines has announced that it has completed the flight and delivery of the second round shipments of life saving medical supplies to fight COVID-19 donated by Jack Ma to all African countries. Ethiopian Airlines expressed gratitude and the appreciation to the Jack Ma Foundation, saying: “our Prime Minister H.E. Dr. Abiy Ahmed, WFP and the African CDC for giving us the opportunity to serve Africa, our beloved continent and our African brothers and sisters during this unprecedented global health and economic crisis.” The airline noted that as an indigenous Pan-African airline which has been serving Africa by Africans, there was nothing more pleasing for the 17,000 strong work force at Ethiopian Airlines, “than coming to the rescue of our African people specially in delivering lifesaving COVID-19 medical supplies.” The Group CEO of Ethiopian Airlines Group, Mr. Tewolde GebreMariam, said, “It is a special honour for the entire Ethiopian Airlines family to be selected as logistics partner and distribution hub for Africa by the Jack Ma foundation, our Prime Minster, WFP and the African CDC. “This project which is running its second round of shipment delivery showed the true African integration in line with the AU Vision 2063. It is a role model for what Africa can achieve in its quest for continental integration. We are also happy to see the fruits of our multi hundred million dollars investment in cargo infrastructure now coming to save Africa from the COVID-19.” It is to be recalled that Ethiopian successfully delivered the first round of donation of Jack Ma and Alibaba Foundation to African countries, which was initiated by Ethiopian Prime Minister, Dr Abiy Ahmed. “Thanks to the established capacity of Ethiopian Cargo & Logistics Services in terms of dedicated staff, state-of-the art facilities and young fleet, Addis Ababa has recently been designated as Humanitarian Air Hub by WFP and WHO to dispatch critical supplies across Africa,” the airline said.
