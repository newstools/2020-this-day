By Francis Sardauna The Katsina State Governor, Aminu Masari, has ordered the total lockdown of Daura Local Government Area of the state after samples taken from three suspects came back positive for the ravaging coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Masari, who disclosed this at a press conference Friday, said the samples of the wife and two children of the index case, Dr Aliyu Mustapha, who died last Saturday, were those that came back positive. He explained that the woman and two children have been admitted at the isolation centre at the Federal Medical Centre, Katsina, where they are receiving treatment. He said the 23 persons that came in contact with the index case had their samples taken a few days ago, adding that most of them came back negative with the exception of the three patients. Masari, who said the lockdown will commence 7am on Saturday, however added that three to four pharmacies and grain stores would remain open to allow residents get their daily necessities. According to him, security operatives would be on ground to ensure total compliance with the shutdown, including regulating how residents would patronize the opened pharmacies and grain stores. He explained that additional tests were still on-going in the council area, with a view to determining those that may have contracted the disease since the index case was identified a week ago. The governor warned that the state government would not waste time to lock down any local government where it is found to have persons positive with the disease. He said: “The lockdown should have commenced Friday, but the open window was given to allow people buy whatever they need.”
