By Ernest Chinwo The Rivers State Government on Sunday released the 22 members of staff of Exxon Mobil who were arrested for violating the state Executive Order restricting movement in the state. The state Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Prof. Zaccheus Adangor, said the Mobil staff were released without charges.

The attorney-general noted that he monitored the release of the 22 Exxon Mobil staff at the state isolation centre at the Yakubu Gowon Stadium in Port Harcourt. He noted that the Rivers State Government remains committed to implementing the Executive Order issued to check the spread of coronavirus.
