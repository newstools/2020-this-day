Speaking shortly after he was discharged on Thursday night at about 9.10pm, an elated Bala Mohammed declared, “I went through hell while in isolation for treatment, I felt like I was alone but the love, affection and prayers shown to me by the people of Bauchi State really kept me going.” The governor who thanked the people of Bauchi State for standing by him all through the trying period said, “I cannot hide my health status but if by doing so I have offended anyone, I apologize for that. It was really a trying time for me, glory to God that I was able to pass the test”. He also said, “the situation was made worse by the kidnap of my elder brother but we thank God for his release. I have learnt a great lesson during this period and it has further strengthened me and inspired me to do more for the people of Bauchi State.” Governor Mohammed however called on people of the state not to bother to come to his office or Government House for sympathy visit saying, “Because of the social distancing practice directive, I appeal to our supporters to stay at home and continue to pray for divine intervention in the situation.”
