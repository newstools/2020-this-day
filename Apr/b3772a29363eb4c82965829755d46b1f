According to the Police Public Relations Officer in Lagos, Bala Elkana, Bello, singer Azeez Fashola, also known as Naira Marley and other persons at the party have been asked to report at the State CID Yaba on Monday or risk being declared wanted.

The regulation stated: “Where there is a violation of a closedown or stay-at-home order, security agencies shall have the power to arrest without warrant and may detain any person, who violates the closedown or stay-at-home order, for at least 48 hours. “Where the arrested person is found guilty, the person is liable to a fine of N100,000 or one month imprisonment or three months’ community service.” According to the police spokesman, this will be a test of the new law passed by the State Assembly and signed by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu. It was also gathered that the Attorney General is expected to be in court since they (Funke Akindele and her husband) will be the first to be arraigned for flouting the restriction law.
