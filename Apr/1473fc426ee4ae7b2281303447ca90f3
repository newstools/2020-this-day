Ugo Aliogo The Nigeria Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG) has distributed hand sanitisers, safety gears to tanker drivers and other vulnerable members at various operational locations. According to a statement jointly signed by the National President of NUPENG, Williams Akporeha, and General Secretary, Afolabi Olawale, the union carefully engaged a pharmaceutical company to produce the sanitiser specifically for its members in Nigeria. The statement explained that the sanitisers come in 10 litres transparent jerry cans to serve as refill for dispensers with other safety kits, such as hand gloves and mouth masks, “which we had already distributed across to all our zonal offices in Port Harcourt, Kaduna, Warri and Lagos.” It explained there are 154 petroleum loading depots across the country, adding that presently there are 120 of these numbers in active operation. According to the statement: “Petroleum Tanker Drivers (PTD) Branch of NUPENG has about 300 places across the country that serve as their Stop-Over-Point for resting and recreation, we will be distributing these items to all these places too. “Conservatively, we will be sending out about a 1000 of these items every week until the siege is over. ADCEM pharmaceutical company may not have the capacity to meet this demand and we are in talks with other companies to support this production. We are also going to provide further logistics and support to our members as we deemed necessary. Oil and Gas Workers need all your support at this period and we are doing this from the meager savings we have.”
