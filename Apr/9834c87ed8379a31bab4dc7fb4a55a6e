The Inspector General of Police (IG), Mr. Mohammed Adamu, has ordered the deployment of Ms Janet Agbede as the new Commissioner of Police in Abia. A statement by the Force Public Relations Officer, DCP Frank Mba, in Abuja yesterday, said Agbede would take over from Mr. Okon Ene who had been redeployed to the Force Headquarters. He said the deployment of Agbede followed the unprofessional conduct and misuse of a firearm by a policeman in Ebem Ohafia area of the state that led to the death of one Ifeanyi Arunsi. The IG condemned the unfortunate incident that happened on Friday, adding that it was glaring that the policeman was unprofessional in his conduct. He condemned the resort to self-help by some people in the area and the destruction of government property and operational assets of the police. Adamu also constituted a Special Investigation Panel headed by Mr. Anthony Ogbizi, the Deputy Inspector General of Police in charge of the Force Criminal Investigation Department. He said the panel would carry out a comprehensive investigation into the unfortunate incident. According to him, the panel will review police actions and inactions prior, during and after the death of Arunsi and the circumstances surrounding the attack on the police station and damage on property.
