Leading health brand, Dettol has donated her hygiene products to Ogun State in support of government’s fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. The donation forms part of Dettol’s contribution to the Ogun State government’s stimulus package of relief materials to cater for the 500, 000 vulnerable homes affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. According to the Ogun State Governor, Prince Dr. Dapo Abiodun, the packages include staple food items and other essential hygiene products such as hand sanitisers produced by the Ogun State Ministry of Health, antibacterial soaps, stain removers and water packs, adding that the goal of the exercise was to keep all families in the best condition during the compulsory stay-at-home period. According to the General Manager, RB West Africa, Mr. Dayanand Sriram, “RB is proud to support Ogun State government’s stimulus package and the distribution of relief materials to citizens across the state during the lockdown. “This contribution is in line with Dettol’s decades-long efforts to curb the spread of infectious diseases caused by bacteria and viruses, as well as the promotion of good hygiene practices in Nigeria. We will continue to support the federal and state governments, as well as the health authorities’ efforts in the fight against COVID-19.” Dettol, through its flagship Dettol Clean Naija Initiative, a campaign designed to educate and drive behavioural change to achieve a cleaner and healthier Nigeria, has been at the forefront of sensitisation programmes to arrest the spread of COVID-19 in Nigeria.
