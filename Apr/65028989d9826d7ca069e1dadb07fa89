The National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) has announce that it successfully passed the ISO/IEC 27001:2013 Re-Certification Audit. The success of the re-certification exercise implies that the NIMC operates an Information Security Management System (ISMS) that protects the data of the citizens in line with the requirements of the ISO 27001:2013. The exercise which involved extensive evaluation of People, Technology and Processes within the Commission, was conducted by the British Standard Institute (BSI), in line with best global practices. The re-certification, therefore, demonstrates the Commission’s continuous strive for quality and safety of our systems, products and services, while embracing innovation to always perform at the optimum. While receiving the certificate on behalf of the Commission, the Director-General/CEO, Aliyu Aziz stated; “NIMC has maintained this certificate since 2014, with an annual surveillance audit being carried out ever since by an independent third party to ensure compliance with the requirements of the standard.” He further noted that re-certification underscores the Commission’s commitment to applying global information security best practices in protecting citizens’ information while also building a culture of security and privacy in line with our organizational mandate. According to the Head, Corporate Communications at NIMC, Kayode Adegoke, “The re-certification is valid for three years, starting from 22nd April 2020 till 21st April 2023.”
