Oluchi Chibuzor As parts of the effort to cushion the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) in Nigeria, the Stephen Akintayo Foundation has donated the N2 million to vulnerable Nigerians. This also included the sum of N1 million given to an online grocery stores to distribute food to residents of Ajegunle. The Chief Executive Officer of Gtext Homes and Founder Stephen Akintayo Foundation, Mr. Stephen Akintayo, who disclosed this in Lagos, said the gesture was a relief package to orphanages and the most vulnerable in Nigeria. According to Akintayo, “This is not the season to think of you and your family alone, this is the season to give. We need to be our brothers’ keepers by ensuring that those that do not have benefit from our deeds of kindness as this will also go a long way in helping people stay off the street to forestalling the spread of the epidemic in Nigeria. “I am also using this opportunity to call on our partners, friends and other Nigerians both corporates and individuals to see the need to give to the vulnerable among us,” he said. Meanwhile, other organisations that benefitted included Gideon Orphanage and Widow homes and Tivid Orphanage Home Int’l, that also received N250,000 relief donation from the Foundation. He also noted that, “Maiduguri IDP Camp will also benefit through a non-governmental organisation that will buy food items and distribute as well as medicine for the hospital in the IDP Camp.” Meanwhile, N1 million has been given to an e-commerce website, www.ginido.com, that will be distributing groceries to communities in Ajegunle and other areas
