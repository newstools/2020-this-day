By Ayodeji Ake The Nigerian Army, in a joint operation with the Lagos State Neighbourhood Security Corps (LNSC), has nabbed lockdown violators who were jogging on Gbagada Expressway, Lagos. Some residents of Lagos State have been violating the lockdown directive by embarking on jogging and other forms of exercise, especially in Ikorodu, Mile 12 and Gbagada. In pictures that went viral on social media platforms in the early hours of Wednesday, the Nigerian Army and LNSC were seen punishing violators. Some Lagos residents commended the military and paramilitary personnel for swinging into action as part of measures to halt the spread of COVID-19 in the country. The Chief Press Secretary to Lagos State Governor, Gboyega Akosile, on his Twitter handle, @gboyegaakosile said: “But you must go out in the name of exercises. So the Nigerian security agencies including the Army, have swung into action to make it easier for them to burn the calories this morning on Gbagada Expressway. This looks like frog jump.” @IgataLawrence said: “Fantastic! They will get closer to their workout goals now that military men have become their gym instructors, it’s a win-win for them.” Another Twitter user, @eskidon said: “Better way to treat them, before some unscrupulous elements will gather to say Army is maltreating them.” @oladejo_amusat: “Highly commendable, good job. By fire, by force, we must obey d constituted authority”.
