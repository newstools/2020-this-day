They added that they had stopped their brother from entering their house and that he should be brought into isolation.

It was also gathered that the tanker driver was taken straight to the isolation ward at the Minna General Hospital where he will be subjected to a series of tests to confirm his status. The Deputy Chairman of the COVID-19 committee in Niger State and Commissioner for Health, Dr. Mohammed Makun Sidi, confirmed the story, saying the action of the relations of the tanker driver was commendable, describing it also as “the outcome of series of sensitisation mounted by the Taskforce.” He however said that the Taskforce could not confirm or deny the status of the tanker driver because these days “anybody who has minor cough and sneezing can be said to be showing symptoms of the pandemic.” Makun Sidi also said the driver of a top politician in the state who was said to be on the run had been brought into the isolation centre in Bida, “in fact he will complete his isolation tomorrow (Saturday). hours daily to 12 hours.
