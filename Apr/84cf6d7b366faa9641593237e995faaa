By Bennett Oghifo Elizade Autoland/JAC Motors has donated a new JAC T6 Pickup 4WD to Lagos State in support of the fight against Corona Virus (Covid-19). The pandemic has led to the shutdown of virtually all activities both from government and private sectors, thereby crippling major sectors of the economy. According to a statement by the company, the Managing Director/CEO, Elizade JAC Autoland, Demola Ade-ojo said the initiative was part of their social responsibility to support the efforts of the government at this trying time. He acknowledged the efforts of organisations that have supported in various capacities, saying “It is rather unfortunate that we are in a trying period in Nigeria due to the global pandemic; to defeat this, all hands must be on deck. Therefore, I am beckoning on business leaders and entrepreneurs in the private sector to give maximum support to the government against the spread of the Covid-19. “I acknowledge efforts of organizations who have supported in different capacities and want to say “This shall pass”. I also commend the Lagos State government for being proactive in its response to curb the spread of the disease to a large number of the citizens of Lagos State.” JAC Motors is the only Chinese brand with full range of vehicles across all segments in Nigeria. Some of the models include the J4 sedan, S2, S3, S5, S7 (SUVs) as well as T6 pickup, Sunray bus X5 pickup, L40 Truck and the N-Series-3tons, 4tons, 5tons, 7tons and 10 tons which can be adopted to various applications.
