Tyson Fury’s team will reportedly try to convince Deontay Wilder to step down from a proposed third fight with their client so that he can take on Anthony Joshua sooner rather than later. Following The Gypsy King’s stunning victory over Wilder in February there has been much anticipation over a potential huge clash between the two British heavyweights, but Wilder exercised a right in his contract to take on Fury again first, with the rematch scheduled for July. However, the coronavirus crisis has wreaked havoc with the sporting calendar, and as a result that fight will have to be pushed back, with October looking the most likely new date. That in turn would see any possible Fury v Joshua bout postponed, with the clash mooted for November or December before the COVID-19 outbreak, but according to the Metro Fury’s promotional team, which include FrankWarren and Bob Arum, want their client to be released from his obligation to fight Wilder again. Fury is said to be far more interested in a unification fight with Joshua than taking on Wilder for a third time, and the current circumstancesmean it would be some time before that happens if all the current proposed fights go ahead at a later date. Joshua is locked in to fight his IBF mandatory Kubrat Pulev in June, but again that bout is highly likely to be pushed back over public health fears. Arum, however, also promotes Pulev, and therefore is hopeful he can convince the Bulgarian to step aside from the fight altogether to free up Joshua to take on Fury later this year. Fury reacted to news of his third fight with Wilder being postponed earlier this week, saying: “I’ll be obliged to give him a bit more. You never get boredof beating Deontay Wilder , obviously. “I’m looking forward to getting this coronavirus out of the way, getting the world back on track and getting back to my job.”
