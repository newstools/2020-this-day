The United States suffered 1,169 deaths related to the coronavirus pandemic in 24 hours, breaking a new record for the most fatalities any country has reported in a day and pushing the total death toll to over 6,000. The previous record was set in Italy on March 27, when it reported 969 new coronavirus deaths in one day at the height of its outbreak, although Italy is obviously a much smaller country. The Johns Hopkins University coronavirus pandemic trackershows that 6,058 people have now died in the U.S. and 245,573 have tested positive. Global cases shot to over a million on Thursday and over 53,000 people have died. (Daily Beast)
