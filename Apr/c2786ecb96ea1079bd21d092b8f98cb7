There was pandemonium around 4p.m thursday at Eneka in Obio/Akpor Local Government Area of Rivers State as a policeman working with the stateâ€™s task force shot and killed a policewoman. The policewoman was on a different assignment and was said to have approached the task force to stop them from harassing some traders along the road when she met her waterloo. It was however gathered that the killing of the woman was an accident as the policeman was targeting another person before the bullet went off and hit the policewoman. The State Commissioner of Police, Mr. Joseph Mukan, could not be reached as at press time but a senior police officer at the state Police Command, confirmed the incident, saying the errant policeman had been arrested and undergoing orderly room trial.
