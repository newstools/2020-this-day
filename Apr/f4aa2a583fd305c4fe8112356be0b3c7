In a recent interview , he said, “I decided to collaborate with veteran actor, Jide Kosoko, and actress, Kemi Afolabi, to produce a historic wedding-inspired video for my yet-to-be-released single, Ekaite. I want it to be unique I have plans to change the music industry forever with the type of content I would produce for music lovers. The music industry is suffering an unfortunate decline in good storyline and delivery, so I have taken it upon myself to bring back the good old days with evergreen songs and visuals. In 2019, my song, Forget About Love, was generally accepted and that really encouraged me.” Recalling how he started his music career, the singer said, “I started doing music with the aim of inspiring and motivating people. I then decided to enlarge my coast by officially flying my own label, Mansa Musa Music. I actually started music as a rapper but I later switched to afropop and afrobeat to attract global fans. “I plan to reach out to every member of the black race and add value to the ever growing music scene. I see my record label as a global force and I am very positive about the acceptance of my style.’’
