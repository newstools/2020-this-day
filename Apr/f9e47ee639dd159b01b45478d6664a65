By Yinka Olatunbosun Ugandan pop star and opposition leader Bobi Wine, whose real name is Kyagulanyi Ssentamu has lent his hand of support to the government in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic with his latest recording of a one minute fifty-four seconds informational music video titled, “Corona Virus Alert”. In it, Wine educated the public on the dangers of the new coronavirus and the precautionary measures they should take to fight its spread. Wine, who released a song in March 2020 urged his listeners to wash their hands to stop the spread of the new coronavirus. The song was a product of a conversation with his friend and long-time collaborator Nubian Li, who is featured on the track. “The bad news is that everyone is a potential victim. But the good news is that everyone is a potential solution,” Wine declares in the song’s intro. “Sensitise the masses to sanitise. Keep a social distance and quarantine,” the 38-year-old adds. A controversial music figure and potent government critic, Wine’s attempts to perform and hold rallies have been rebutted by authorities. He has complained of harassment and beatings by security forces when they block his public appearances. Authorities accuse him of trying to lure young people into rioting and have charged him with multiple criminal offenses, including treason, which he denies. Bobi Wine made his first appearance in Nigeria at the 2019 Felabration as one of the guests during the Fela Debates held at NECA building, Alausa Ikeja.
