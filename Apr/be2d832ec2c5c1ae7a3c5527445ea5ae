Chris Uba The Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) has published an extract of the international standard AFNOR SPEC-S76-001:2020 on production and delivery of essential materials. A statement from the office of the Director General, Osita Aboloma , disclosed that the 6-page handbill was to serve as quick guide to users as well as makers of face masks across the length and breadth of the country, particularly the micro, small and medium scale enterprises. Aboloma, stated that the guidelines became necessary in view of the emergency situation occasioned by the lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The document according to him focused on scope, description, coverage, materials, safety features and test of barrier masks as well as instructions on the proper usage and disposal of the masks. The SON Chief Executive said the document was being disseminated through social media platforms as well as the regular media to ensure its rapid spread. He stated this became imperative in view of the mass production being commissioned by some state governments, corporate bodies as well as smaller units by families across the country. According to Aboloma, SON was already working with all other 14-member countries of the Economic Community of West African States and the
ECOWAS Commission to harmonise the standards for barrier masks in the fight against the pandemic in the region. The ECOWAS Standards Technical Management Committee has thus set up a Task Force to be Chaired by Nigeria while Mali serves as Secretary, to harmonise the standard within the shortest possible time through virtual meetings online, he said. Other members of the Task Force according to the SON Chief Executive are Senegal, Cote Dâ€™ Voire, The Gambia, Ghana and Cape Verde.
