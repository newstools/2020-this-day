The BUA Foundation, the philanthropic arm of BUA Group, yesterday announced that it has released N300million to the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 to aid the operations of the taskforce. The donation was in line with the earlier pledge made by the Founder/Chairman of BUA, Mr. Abdul Samad Rabiu. The foundation also announced that it has released the sum of N100million each to Kwara, Kaduna, Ekiti and Rivers States while the sum of N200million was given to Lagos State. These donations were distinct from its N1billion health infrastructure intervention grant being provided to equip a permanent health facility in Lagos. The new donations were not part of N1 billion the BUA Foundation had earlier disbursed to the CACOVID Private Sector Coalition and the distribution of N100million each to Sokoto, Ogun and Edo States in the fight against the spread of the virus in Nigeria. Rabiu said that it is important for the private sector to step in and support the country’s efforts in combating the virus and its attendant effects. He said: “BUA Foundation is already working closely with the Presidential Task Force, NCDC and other stakeholders on how best to deploy these funds to immediately equip the selected facilities in Kano and Lagos within the next few weeks. These grants will be disbursed and monitored in line with globally accepted best practice.” He also assured that the BUA Group would continue to monitor the situation and would even do more to provide support to areas that are in need. “We need each other to come together in fighting this virus,” he said.
