Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has warned banks closing their operations in the state amidst the war against the COVID-19 pandemic, to rethink their decisions. The governor, in a statement by the state Commissioner for Information and Communication, Paulinus Nsirim, said any bank found closing its operations would find it difficult to reopen in the state. The statement further clarified that the curfew imposed at Education Bus Stop to Agip Junction, Ikwerre Road and Obiri Ikwerre Junction to Ozuoba, Rumualogu and Choba was for 24 hours with effect from yesterday. The governor said: “It has also come to the notice of the state government that some banks are closing down in the state. The curfew is targeted at only some parts of the state. “Therefore, banks have no excuse to shut down their operations. Any bank that is found to be closed will find it very difficult to reopen for business in the state.”
