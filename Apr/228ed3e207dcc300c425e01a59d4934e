Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja The Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) yesterday invited the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to investigate many cases of unexecuted contracts awarded by the commission. It also called on the anti-graft agency to assist the firms contracted to undertake a forensic audit of the commission by the federal government. Speaking during a courtesy visit to the agency, the Acting Managing Director of the Commission, Professor Kemebradikumo Pondei, requested the commission’s assistance in looking at cases of contracts awarded and paid for but not executed. The NDDC boss said the commission was inundated with petitions from communities on abandoned projects. He said the flurry of petitions had become a source of distraction to the management committee even as he requested a status report on all NDDC cases being investigated by the EFCC. “We have reports of projects awarded and paid for but not executed. There is need for us to work on these cases”, he said. In his remarks, the EFCC Zonal Head, Port Harcourt, Usman Imam, described the visit by the NDDC team as remarkable, noting that it would go a long way in helping to bridge the gap that  exist between the agencies. While congratulating the interim management committee on its appointment, Imam pointed out that its assignment appears daunting in the face of extreme negative public perception of the agency. He noted that when he assumed office as Zonal Head in Port Harcourt, he believed that NDDC was next to oil bunkering when it comes to corruption.
