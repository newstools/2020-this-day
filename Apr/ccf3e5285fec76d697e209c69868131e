Rebecca Ejifoma The Lagos State Fire Service has successfully averted a major fire outbreak at the Ikeja Airport Hotel, Lagos, although it razed down some vehicles stationed at the premises, and also affected a nearby company. The Lagos State Emergency Management Authority (LASEMA) Response Team was said to be on ground to curtail the inferno. Confirming the incident last night, the Director General and Chief Executive Officer of LASEMA, Dr. Olufemi Damilola Oke-Osanyintolu, said: “We received multiple reports of a fire outbreak at Ikeja Airport Hotel along Obafemi Awolowo Way in Ikeja.” “On arrival at the scene, three vehicles including one Toyota coaster bus (LND133XW), a Honda civic saloon car (AKR234LZ) and a Cadillac Escalade car with unknown registration number had gutted fire.” He confirmed that the fire affected the Tour Africa Transport Company within the hotel premises and not the hotel building itself. “The flames have since been extinguished by our responders and the Lagos State Fire Service and an investigation is being carried out to know the cause of the fire”. He, therefore, appealed for calm and promised to provide further updates
