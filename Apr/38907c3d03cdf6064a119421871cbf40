By John Shiklam A fresh case of Covid-19 has been recorded in Kaduna, raising the number of active cases in the state to four. The state’s Commissioner for Health, Dr. Amina Baloni, disclosed this in a statement on Saturday in Kaduna. She said the new patient had contact with the three patients who tested positive earlier in the week. The commissioner said: ‘’Contact tracing is ongoing to identify persons the new case had interacted with so that they can be monitored and tested if they meet the case definition.’’ She said medical professionals were attending to the four active cases in the state who are receiving treatment at the Infectious Diseases Centre (IDC). Baloni said: “Medical professionals in the Ministry of Health have already successfully managed the first six Covid-19 cases in the state to full recovery and discharge. ‘’The index case, Malam Nasir el-Rufai, was discharged on April, 22, 2020, after two consecutive negative test results. Five cases were earlier discharged in the one week, starting from 14 April 2020.’ The commissioner said testing capacity in the state is improving, adding that Kaduna State has ‘’one lab that has been accredited by NCDC to conduct Covid-19 tests”. She said the two labs located in Kaduna and Zaria were undergoing NCDC verification and are expected to secure test accreditation shortly. She disclosed that as at Friday, 24 April, 2020, the state had tested 133 persons, out of which 10 tested positive. The statement reiterated the need for people to always wash their hands and imbibe the culture of personal hygiene, social distancing and the avoidance of large gatherings so as to stop the spread of Covid-19.
