By James Sowole Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, has said the COVID-19 index case in the state is a military officer who has just returned from India. “He has been in isolation since he returned and has been monitored by the medical team of the Military and our state team throughout this period. “Upon showing some symptoms, his samples were taken and the diagnosis confirmed by Nigeria Centre for Disease Control at their lab in Ede. We have now commenced the transfer of the officer to the state isolation center,” the governor said. Akeredolu had earlier on his Twitter handle announced the status of the state on CONVID -19 table. The governor said: “We have just received confirmation of our first positive COVID-19 case this evening. The infected person is currently under isolation and would be monitored “We have activated all necessary protocol to locate all contacts and we’ve been working closely with NCDC @ NCDC gov.” The governor’s tweet was followed by a statement signed by the Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Mr Donald Ojogo. The statement read: “It is with great concern that the Ondo State Government announces the first index case. A suspected case tested positive to the COVID-19 pandemic. “We thank God for His protection thus far. Ours has been a case of anxiety while we enjoyed a COVID-19 free state status. This development has, however, repudiated that enviable status even as we urge all to be vigilant and keep ourselves within the princints of measures put in place.”
