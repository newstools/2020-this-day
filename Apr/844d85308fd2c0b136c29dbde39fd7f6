The Alapomu of Apomu in Osun State, Oba Kayode Adenekan Afolabi, has kick-started the distribution of food materials in Apomu, headquarters of Isokan Local Government Area in the state. The relief packages were donated by Alapomu and concerned indigenes of Apomuland. The donations are meant to provide succour for the needy and vulnerable people as a result of COVID-19 pandemic. Alapomu said the initiative is also to support the efforts of Governor Gboyega Oyetola in providing assistance to the poor and needy in the various communities in view of the pandemic. “Government alone cannot provide for everyone without support from individuals and groups,” he said Apomu COVID-19 Relief Fund Project was initiated by Alapomu and a committee was set up with Professor Sina Oladokun as Chairman and Professor Lateef Agbaje as the Secretary. Mr. Waheed Oladejo is in charge of Field Operations. The committee also supervised the packaging of the food materials which include rice, beans, garri, vegetable oil, and loaves of bread. All the food items were sourced from Apomu to boost local economy. Alapomu expressed his appreciation to Asiwaju of Apomuland, members of the committee and those illustrious sons and daughters of Apomuland who contributed to make the project a success.
