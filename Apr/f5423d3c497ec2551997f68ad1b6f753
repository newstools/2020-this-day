By Goddy Egene Investors in equities heaved a heavy sigh of relief last week as the market posted significant recovery and ended with improved turnover. The stock market had suffered a decline of 3.51 per cent the previous week due to the impact of the economic lockdown following the COVID-19 pandemic. However, bargain hunting by discerning investors saw the market recover N150 billion last week. Specifically, the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) All-Share Index rose 1.37 per cent, while market capitalisation appreciated to N11.144 trillion, from N10.994 trillion. All other indices finished higher with the exception of NSE Oil/Gas, NSE Lotus II and NSE Industrial Goods which depreciated by 4.76 per cent, 2.65 per cent and 6.59 per cent while NSE ASeM Index closed flat. An analysis of the sectoral performance showed that the NSE Banking Index led with a jump of 12.4 per cent, trailed by the NSE Consumer Goods Index that appreciated by 6.5 per cent. The NSE Insurance Index chalked up 0.2 per cent. Conversely, the NSE Industrial Goods Index recorded the highest decline of 6.6 per cent, trailed by the NSE Oil & Gas Index with a fall of 4.8 per cent. However, the volume and value of shares traded rose significantly as investors exchanged 2.440 billion shares worth N19.932 billion in 18,918 deals last week in contrast to a total of 1.534 billion shares valued at N11.267 billion that exchanged hands last week in 18,928 deals the previous week. The high turnover was recorded despite the fact that trading was only four days last week following the declaration of Friday as public holiday by the federal government. Some market analysts said despite closing positively last week, risks still persists in the market, due to the challenges in the macro-economy. “Despite the market closing positive risks remain on the horizon, given the rising cases of COVID-19 in Nigeria. More so, our base case is for the FGN to extend the presently instituted lockdown in Lagos, Abuja, and Ogun, by another one week. Thus, we advise investors to trade cautiously, taking positions in fundamentally justified stocks,” analysts at Cordros Securities Limited said.
