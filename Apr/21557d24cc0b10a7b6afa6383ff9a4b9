The deputy governor said the samples taken from Pulka would be sent for testing. He said the nine positive cases had been captured by the National Centre for Disease Control, NCDC, in its national update released on Tuesday night. The Deputy Governor said on a sad note, that an infected indigene had died. The citizen who was transferred from Biu to Maiduguri, had tested positive in Gombe, after his return from Lagos.

The lockdown commenced on Wednesday night, after the state governor imposed a-14 day statewide lockdown. The deputy governor said security officials would enforce the lockdown by using lawful means to restrict all movements. He said exemptions will be to persons who will be on essential services. The Deputy Governor called on residents not to stigmatize persons infected with COVID-19 or their families, noting such stigmatization will heighten resistance of patients from being moved to government isolation and treatment centres. He called on citizens to show empathy to infected persons rather than show disregard for them. Information Commissioner, Babakura Abba Jato, in his comments, announced that coalition of civil societies in the state had set up a situation room as part of its contribution. He announced the following emergency phone numbers: 09072127272 and 09068685158 through which citizens can make contacts on medical issues relating to Covid-19.
