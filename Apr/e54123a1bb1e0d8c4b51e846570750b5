By Laleye Dipo The National Examination Council (NECO) has said that it does not have plans to shift the conduct of the Senior Secondary School Examination (SSCE) and the Basic Education Common Entrance Examination (BECE). The Head of Information and Public Relations Division of NECO, Alhaji Azeez Sani, made this known in a statement in Minna on Wednesday. Sani said in the statement that apart from the National Common Entrance Examination (NCEE), which has been postponed as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, all other examinations under its purview remain as planned. “NECO wishes to state categorically that apart from the 2020 National Common Entrance (NCEE) that was postponed indefinitely due to the outbreak of COVID-19, the Council has not reviewed any of its remaining Examination Time Tables (BECE) and (SSCE), neither is it contemplating such for now,” it said. Sani however said that the examination body “is monitoring the prevailing situation in the country and will make official pronouncement on the examinations if the need arises”. He therefore urged students, especially candidates that will sit for the examination, to disregard any information that the two tests have been shifted.
