By Martins Ifijeh The Niger State Government has declared a total lockdown in the state for two weeks as part of measures to halt the spread of COVID-19. Announcing this after an emergency executive meeting in Minna Saturday, the state Governor, Abubakar Bello said the decision became necessary after the confirmation of one positive case of COVID-19. The lockdown is billed to commence Monday April 13. Bello said: “The patient is a returnee from Lagos State and resides at Limawa community in Minna. “Limawa community will also be in isolation for the two weeks period with health workers engaged to sensitise its residents within the period.” He said all religious gatherings in churches and mosques had been suspended till further notice, adding that he regretted the earlier decision to relax the restriction order that was in place. “We are liaising with local tailors association in the state for production of face masks in view of the scarcity of the items. “Health workers would also be engaged at strategic points with thermometers to carry out regular temperature tests,” he added. The governor, who said palliatives would be provided to the poorest in the society, warned politicians not to hijack the items by the time they are released.
