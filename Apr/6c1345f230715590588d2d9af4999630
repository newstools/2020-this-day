By Bennett Oghifo As Christians commemorate this year’s Easter, the Corps Marshal, Federal Road Safety Corps Dr. Boboye Oyeyemi has called on all motorists to sustain the adherence to the respective lockdown orders and to the maximum safety and health standards in vehicles amidst the rising cases of COVID-19 in the country. A statement by the Corps Public Education Officer, Bisi Kazeem, said the Corps Marshal felicitated with Christian faithfuls, adding that all personnel have been adequately briefed on the imperatives of sustaining the tempo on the ongoing enforcement on overloading of vehicles and mandatory adherence to the social distance directive by all passengers on board, especially as the country continues to battle the deadly virus. He, however, emphasised that the focus would be high on Lagos, Ogun and the Federal Capital Territory where presidential lockdown was imposed. According to statement, Oyeyemi “while felicitating with the Christian faithfuls ahead of this year’s celebration of the crucifixion, death and resurrection of Christ, beckoned on them to manifest love care and obedience to established laws so as to portray the lessons of the Holy Week in positive light.” He noted that the Corps would continue to sustain all arrangements on the lockdown, as enforcement on all forms of overloading of vehicles and social distancing order was still on, even during and beyond the celebration period. He said the country cannot risk unwanted spread of the virus beyond what has been recorded at the moment, and urged them to stay at home and stay alert. “The Corps Marshal further called on Nigerians to cooperate with law enforcement agents and ensure maximum compliance with all directives on restrictions and social distancing.”
