Idowu Sowunmi The Pax Herbal Clinic and Research Laboratories (PHCRL), an alternative medicine product manufacturing company in Ewu-Esan in Edo State, has developed a novel drug, called PaxHerbal CVD Plus for the treatment of COVID-19 pandemic. These breakthroughs were disclosed wednesday by the founder of PHCRL, popularly known as PaxHerbal, Dr. Anselm Adodo, who explained that the PaxHerbal CVD Plus contained herbs and active phytoconstituents with documented scientific evidence based on clinical reports of their efficacy and safety. Adodo said that plant-based drugs, whether crude or refined, seemed to be the best alternative approach to treat COVID-19. He said: “At the moment, plant-based drugs, whether crude or refined, are seemingly the best alternative approach to the treatment of COVID-19 menace. The new generation of vaccine development for combating emergent diseases needed time because of safety profiling. “On the other hand, plant-based formulations are easily manufactured, stored and distributed and are readily acceptable by the local population. Moreover, they can easily be handled by both professional and non-medical research personnel with no risk of contamination. “The PHCRL has developed a novel drug, called PaxHerbal CVD Plus specifically for the treatment of COVID-19. “These herbs have been used in several therapeutic formulations of Paxherbals over the past 25 years for the treatment of hepatitis C, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, bronchitis, pneumonia and malaria.
