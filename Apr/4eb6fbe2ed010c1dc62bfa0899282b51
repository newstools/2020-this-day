The Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) has set up an independent COVID-19 Funds Monitoring Team charged with the prevention of possible financial abuses that may arise in the management of the Covid-19 special intervention funds. A statement by its media unit on Thursday said that the team will monitor the disbursement and utilisation of the funds, donations and other receipts mobilised towards combating the outbreak of Coronavirus in the country. “The team will deploy appropriate strategy to prevent incidences of corruption that may have negative impact on the efforts of government to deal effectively with the pandemic and its work will complement the efforts of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 with regard to transparency and accountability in the management of the funds”, the statement added. While the commission saluted all those in the frontline of battling the outbreak and everyone facilitating the national effort behind the scene, the anti-graft agency reiterated its earlier advisory to all actors in the management chain of the COVID-19 response to steer clear of all unethical and corrupt acts that could result in criminal investigation and consequences.
