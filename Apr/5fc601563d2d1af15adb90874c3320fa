The First Child and Prisoner Care Foundation (FCAPCF), founded by Ambassador Martins Efe, recently partnered with comedian Igodye’s Francis Agoda Path of Honour (FAPOH) to donate palliatives to orphanage homes to cushion the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. FCAPCF was established with the aim and vision of creating and sustaining a means of advancing the living and economic standards of the less privileged in the society. In view of the objective, the prisoners, handicaps, orphans, widows and vulnerable children have always been its priority. The founder had in 2018, empowered over 50 youths in Nigeria with over N20 million cash to start their entrepreneurial dreams which has provided employment for many today. While appealing to the matrons to comply with the government’s directive on the lockdown to curtail the spread of the virus, Efe said, “I urge all well-meaning Nigerians to support the vulnerable.” He emphasised the need to practice the guidelines of regular hand washing and social distancing among other rules. The foundation gave out over 1,000 face masks, hand sanitizers, bags of rice and other food items to hundreds of homeless Nigerians.
