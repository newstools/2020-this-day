The Chief Executive Officer of Dara’s Interior Concept, Moshood Alabi A, is a well respected entrepreneur with a touch of excellence. Having attended Boston College Johannesburg, South Africa and earned a Diploma in Business Management, the 38-year old creative entrepreneur continues to deliver world-class performance in all the briefs, yet he believes a lot could be done better if the Nigerian government does the needful. “There are two major things I think the government should do to make the environment friendlier for business people. Firstly, is stable electricity, then motorable roads. It is really needed to boost young businesses in the country,” he said.
As part of his qualities, Alabi has a reputation for relationship and personnel management, as well as quality assurance, which he has deployed in taking Dara’s interior concept to heights beyond the pedestrian, he sheds more lights on what inspires him the most at work. “I am a developer. So the sense of responsibility and compassion for my projects, driven by the fact that I was involved in them since their very conception and ability to work on any design, inspire me. Other reasons include – a healthy work environment and hearty colleagues. This give me enough motivation to love my work. I do hate it for few solid reasons too. But I can get along with the job for most of the time. When we started, it was called Dara’s Interior Concept. Founded since 2016. Now it is called Dara’s Interior Concept. We had also encountered different challenges at a starting point, but my team and I always try our possible best to handle them all the time.” The married father of one also advised young people out there striving to succeed in entrepreneurship, “the youths out there should know that whatever they are doing, they should stay focused and believe in themselves. They should always stay humble and loyal to people around them. It pays,” he added.
