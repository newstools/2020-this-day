The Nigerian Basketball Federation (NBBF), has announced the indefinite postponement of the 2020 FIBA Certification Course for its Table Officials earlier slated to commence on the 27th of April. This is due to the coronavirus pandemic and the resultant restrictions of movements all over the world targeted at stemming its spread. Announcing this on Monday, the NBBF Secretary General, Afolabi-Oluwayemi Olabisi said it was imperative to officially inform all stakeholders about the latest development. “Since the Federal Government has announced suspension of non-essential flights in and out of the country as well as total lockdown in Lagos, Ogun State and the Federal Capital Territory, it will be next to impossible and socially irresponsible to still go ahead with the training.” Afolabi-Oluwayemi said staying alive is the primary focus for all while other activities have taken the back seat for now until the world gets out of the conundrum. A new date will be announced once there is a clear signal from relevant authorities saddled with combating the novel Covid-19. “For now, we all need to maintain social-distancing. Those having symptoms should be socially responsible and quarantine themselves while they get in touch with the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) as we all adhere to the safety health tips”, she said.
