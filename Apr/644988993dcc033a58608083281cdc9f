The Anambra State Governor, Chief Willie Obiano, yesterday served out his self-quarantine and directed tailors in the state to produce three million masks for distribution. Addressing the people of the state, Obiano said after the expiration of the 14-day stay-at-home order which began on 24th of March, nobody would move without wearing a mask in the state. He said he had ordered tailors in the state to mass produce no fewer than three million facemasks. “We shall soon commence the distribution of three million masks to residents of Anambra State in the 181 communities in Anambra. “The Igwes (monarchs) and the Presidents- General of communities will assist the government in profiling the tailors in their various communities that will help in mass-producing these masks for distribution to the members of the communities. “Our intention in handing out three million masks is to ensure that after the 14-day shutdown of the state, no one will step out of their home without wearing a facial mask.
