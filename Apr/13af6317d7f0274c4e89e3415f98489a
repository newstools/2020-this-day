The company, said the cover would take care of 200 frontline health workers involved in the containment of the disease in the state, to the tune of N5 million for each health worker to cover their death, permanent disability and medical expenses. LASACO Assurance Managing Director, Mr Segun Balogun, said, in a statement, that the gesture was to boost their morale and motivate the workers. He emphasised the need for such protection for health workers to enable them focus on their duty and not be overwhelmed by the hazards involved.

Balogun, promised that the company would continue to support government in meeting the needs of the people.
