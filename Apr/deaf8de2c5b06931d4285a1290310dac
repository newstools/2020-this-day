President Muhammdu Buhari has said that the level of compliance to the COVID-19 guidelines issued has been generally good across the country. In a broadcast to the nation Monday night to announce the extension of the lockdown imposed on Lagos, Ogun, and the Federal Capital Territory for another 14 days, President Buhari also thanked Nigerians “for the great sacrifice you are making for each other at this critical time.” He specifically recognised what he called the massive support from traditional rulers, the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) and the Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs (NSCIA) during this pandemic. He also acknowledged the support and contributions received from public spirited individuals, the business community and international partners. “I must also thank the media houses, celebrities and other public figures for the great work they are doing in sensitizing our citizens on hygienic practices, social distancing and issues associated with social gatherings”, he added.
