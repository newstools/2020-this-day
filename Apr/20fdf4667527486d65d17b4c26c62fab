By Igbawase Ukumba Governor Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa State on Friday approved the pardon of a total of 125 inmates from correctional centres across the state in order to contain the spread of COVID-19. The Nasarawa governor’s approval to that effect came shortly after President Muhammadu Buhari approved the pardon of 2,600 inmates across the country in the same vein. Sule’s pardon of the 125 inmates was contained in a press release personally signed by him in Lafia, the state capital. Accordingly, the governor directed the state Advisory Council on Prerogative of Mercy to map out modalities for the immediate release of the affected inmates. He said: “The inmates to be released are in the following categories: convicts with fine of N50,000.00 and below, and those with minor offences. “Other categories include those on the grounds of old age (above 60 years), others who have served 75% of their sentences; and convicts with less than 6 months to complete their sentences.”
