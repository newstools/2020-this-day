The World Health Organisation (WHO) has said there are more than 50 trials for a vaccine on COVID-19. The Country Officer for WHO in Nigeria, Fiona Braka, said there is also a multi-country trial for a drug for the virus. Braka said while there is no vaccine for the disease yet, WHO is fast-tracking the process of producing one. She said: “We currently have over 50 vaccine trials that are in place, trying to work round the clock to fast-track the vaccine development process, and we continue to keep countries informed of that process. “When it comes to treatment, WHO is leading a multi-country clinical trial. So far, 45 countries have signed up for that.” The WHO country director added that what is being adopted is a “solidarity trial” that would “test different drugs in four different arms against the normal standard of care we are currently implementing.”
