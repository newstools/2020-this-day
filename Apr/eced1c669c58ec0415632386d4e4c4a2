Peter Uzoho Julius Berger Plc has said it has donated another batch of beds and mattresses, purpose-built container offices and sentry posts to the new Idu Abuja Isolation Centre in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) to support the treatment of COVID-19 patients in the area. The engineering and construction company stated in a statement that the new donation was made yesterday in keeping with its momentum of support and relevant donations to the government and WHO-nominated COVID-19 isolation/treatment centres and health institutions to help fight the pandemic in the country. The company said it had launched a series of corporate social responsibility (CSR) donations including beds, mattresses, food palliatives as well as operational support to city disinfection and fumigation, and other logistical assistance to government at all levels across the country, According to the statement, it would be recalled that sequel to its earlier donation of an ambulance to the University of Abuja Teaching Hospital, Julius Berger also donated a large number of beds and mattresses to the teaching hospital for its COVID-19 roll back efforts in Gwagwalada Abuja, last Thursday. The company noted that another food palliatives distribution project was also in the pipeline for residents of the FCT to prove its increasingly proactive CSR efforts in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. The construction giant added that it would continue to relentlessly commit its resources to stopping the spread of COVID-19 in Nigeria.
