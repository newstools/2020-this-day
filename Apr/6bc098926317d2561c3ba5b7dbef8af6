THISDAY learnt that the three Togolese, namely Mr. Commando Kwasi, Mr. Eberivie Isiaq and Ms. Kemi Terivie, a mother of one, traveled to Cotonou, Republic of Benin in January and came back for the new farming season after the Federal Government of Nigeria has announced a total blockade of country’s borders following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic to stem its spread. The Chairman of Iseyin Local Government, Mr. Mufutau Abilawon, alongside the representatives of Aseyin of Iseyin, Mr. Ismahil Odubiyi and medical members of the COVID-19 committee in the council, were at the residence of the foreigners to ascertain their travel history and medical condition. Abilawon said: “As directed by Oyo State Governor, we are to fish out any case of illegal incursion of foreigners or COVID-19 case as the government is working day and night to stop the spread of this deadly disease. “Members of the COVID-19 committee are here with us and they have questioned the individuals to know their health status and travel history, but we are not stopping at this, we need to have an emergency meeting with all the community chiefs (Baales) tomorrow morning to warn them to desist from harbouring foreigners till this crisis is over. “These are agrarian communities and some of these foreigners are to assist farmers during planting season. But we have to face the reality, our lives are more valuable than any other thing, we must curtail their influx.” One of the immigration officials, who spoke at the scene under condition of anonymity, said one of the Togolese had been around before this week while the other two, Eberivie Isiaq and Kemi Terivie, just arrived.
