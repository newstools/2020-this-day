By Tosin Clegg Two Nigerian companies Xirea Apparel and BuphaloActive Gear have said they would collaborate to boost local capacity for PPE production to combat COVID-19 and other communicable diseases. Buphalo’s certified disposable coveralls and other items are manufactured in Xirea’s world class factory in Trans Amadi, Port Harcourt. Local production capacity will be ramped up for some items in response to the COVID-19 pandemic; certified disposable coveralls, medical/surgical scrubs and caps, surgical masks, and other miscellaneous garments For disposable coveralls during the pandemic, the company has converted all their production lines to produce the BuphaloBDC-13 disposable coveralls in Nigeria, and the daily production capacity is between 2,000 to 5,000 coveralls. The founder of Xirea Apparels, Mr. Obinna Eneh stated that the world has irreversibly changed as a result of the pandemic, saying it was heart-warming to see corporations, government agencies and individuals unite to battle the spread of the coronavirus. “To play our part, Xirea Apparels has retrofitted and dedicated four production lines to the local production of medical PPE,” he said.
