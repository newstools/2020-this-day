Duro Ikhazuagbe with agency report Nigerian duo of Emmanuel Bonaventure Dennis and David Okereke are waiting to be crowned champions of Belgian Jupiler following the decision of the country’s football chiefs to cancel the rest of the season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The league’s board of directors made the decision yesterday and have made a recommendation to the general assembly. In a statement, the league said: “The board of directors unanimously decided that it was not desirable, whatever the scenario envisaged, to continue the competition after 30 June.” Dennis who made his Super Eagles debut in the 2-2 friendly draw with Ukraine on September 10 last year and his Club Brugge are to be named league champions on April 15 when a working group decides those to be relegated and promoted. Dennis was introduced into the Nigeria versus Ukraine game as 82nd minute substitute for Samuel Chukwueze. Brugge were 15 points clear of second placed Gent and have just one more game to play before going into the playoff to decide the winner of the season. The Belgian league normally goes into a playoff system after 30 games to decide champions and European places. When Club Brugge are declared champions, they will automatically qualify for the UEFA Champions League while Gent will go into the ChampionsLeague qualifiers for next season. Nigeria forward Emmanuel Dennis, a key member of the Brugge’s team has now picked up his second league title with the club. He first won the title with the club in the 2017/2018 season. Okereke on the other hand joined Brugge from Italia Serie B outfit, Spezia last summer.
