Petitioners in the dispute over the last election held in Kogi West Senatorial District of Kogi State, Senator Dino Melaye and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) closed their case yesterday. Melaye, the candidate of the PDP, is together with the party, challenging the outcome of the election held on November 16, 2019 and won by Senator Smart Adeyemi of the All Progressives Party (APC). The petitioners announced the closure of their case at the conclusion of the testimony of one of their witnesses, Pastor Femi Obalemo. Obalemo, who claimed to be an accountant, told the election tribunal, which is sitting in Abuja, that he visited 50 polling units during the election. The witness was however silent when reminded that the Electoral Laws do not permit candidates and their agents to move around from one polling unit to the other during an election. At the conclusion of Obalemo’s testimony, the petitioners announced that they were closing their case. Tribunal’s Chairman, Justice Isa Sambo then adjourned till April 28 for continuation of hearing. INEC, listed as the first respondent, is expected to open its case on the next adjourned date.
