Igbawase Ukumba in Lafia Organised Labour in Nasarawa State wednesday rejected plans by local government area chairmen of the state to cut down their monthly salaries by 25 percent. State Chairman of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Yusuf Sarki Iyah, made the position of the Organised Labour known at a press briefing in Lafia, the state capital. According to him, “There is an orchestrated plan by LGAs chairmen in the state to pay March salaries to local government workers on percentages. “Consequently, the Organised Labour met with the Joint Local Government Union, and at the meeting expressed dissatisfaction with plans by the state Ministry for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, LGA chairmen and overseers of Development Areas to pay only 75 percent of salaries to local government workers.” Iya, who described the plans as discrimination in payment of wages, faulted it because workers on the state government payroll were being paid100 percent salaries for the month of March. He said: “We observed the plans as total departure from the vision and mission of the state governor who had mentioned in different forums that the era of percentage payment is over in Nasarawa State. “We unanimously condemned a proposed plan by local government authorities at this moment of self-isolation when workers need more funds to feed their family well.” Iyah, however, warned that any attempt to pay salaries in percentages would not be accepted by the Organised Labour, and would result in industrial action.
