The Chairman of UACN, Mr. Dan Agbor, had last year said the company was embarking on initiatives to boost growth in its business and deliver better returns. According to him, the company was working on a plan to stabilise UPDC, which has been constituting a drain on the group’s performance. “We are encouraged by the initiatives implemented thus far but recognise that a significant amount of work lies ahead. It is important to mention that one of the key elements of the strategic plan of your management is for the company to operate as a much simpler and leaner holding company, with the main focus being on the subsidiary companies. We are strengthening and empowering the management and Boards of subsidiary companies to drive value creation and increasing their accountability for delivering ambitious plans. Towards this end, we are carrying out a comprehensive review of our organisational structure to ensure increased autonomy and effectiveness of operating subsidiary companies,” Agbor said.
