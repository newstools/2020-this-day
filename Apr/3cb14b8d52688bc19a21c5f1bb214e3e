The case, according to the state Commissioner for Health, Dr. Ninkong Lar Ndam, the index case arrived Jos from Kano on 17th April 2020 and has been on quarantine since arrival. He said, “Upon exhibiting symptoms, nasal and oropharyngeal swab was taken and sent to NVRI Vom Laboratory for COVID-19 testing. “Sadly, the result which was released on Thursday, 23rd April 2020 returned positive thereby making the patient the state’s index case.” He said that the patient had since been isolated and was stable and in good medical condition. Ndam added that the State Surveillance Team had immediately commenced contact tracing to investigate the case further and institute other public health measures, including contact tracing, to curb the spread of the disease in the state. Meanwhile, Governor Simon Lalong has implored the public not to panic, but to continue to imbibe good personal and respiratory hygiene, social distancing and avoid crowded places as well as stay at home. He also called on the citizens to be vigilant and report any suspicious case while assisting the government to enforce the border closure directive which is one of the key steps adopted in curbing the disease.
