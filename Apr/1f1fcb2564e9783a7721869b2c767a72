Rebecca Ejifoma The Lagos State Fire Service has averted what could have been a major fire outbreak at the Ikeja Airport Hotel, Lagos, although the fire razed three vehicles in the premises and affected a company within the hotel premises. The Lagos State Emergency Management Authority (LASEMA) Response Team was said to be on ground to curtail the inferno. The DG and CEO LASEMA, Dr. Olufemi Damilola Oke-Osanyintolu, confirming the incident Thursday night, said: “We received multiple reports of a fire outbreak at Ikeja Airport Hotel along Obafemi Awolowo Way in Ikeja.” “On arrival at the scene, three vehicles including one Toyota coaster bus (LND133XW), a Honda civic saloon car (AKR234LZ) and a Cadillac Escalade car with unknown registration number had gutted fire.” The fire outbreak was said to have affected the Tour Africa Transport Company within the hotel premises and not the hotel building itself.. “The flames have since been extinguished by our responders and the Lagos State Fire Service and an investigation is being carried out to know the cause of the fire”. He, therefore, appealed for calm and promised to provide further updates.
