By Chuks Okocha Former President of the Senate, Senator David Mark, has described the Governor of Benue State, Dr. Samuel Ortom, as an uncommon political leader and a man of the people. Paying a glowing tribute to the governor who turned 59 years old Thursday, Senator Mark noted that Ortom was is a “brave soldier” and political tactician who knows the roadmap and fully commits himself to the wellbeing of his people. According to a statement by his media aide, Paul Mumeh, “Ortom’s political trajectory in the contemporary Nigeria especially in Benue State where he navigates to victory in spite of all odds place him above his peers. He has fought titanic battles to defend the Benue valley and kept the people united”. Besides, Senator Mark pointed out that Governor Ortom’s people-oriented policies and programmes which touch directly on the wellbeing of the people particularly the downtrodden, endeared him to Nigerians across board. He therefore enjoined the governor not to rest on his oars but continue to sustain and improve on the good works of delivering the dividends of democracy to the nooks and crannies of Benue State. In doing so, Senator Mark urged him to continue to be guided by sense of equity, justices and fairness to all, for which he is known and esteemed by all. He also charged him to continue to sustain the legacy of peace and one united Benue State as well as his well-documented efforts in defending and protecting the common heritage and destiny of Benue State. Senator Mark prayed that God in His infinite mercies continue to bless Governor Ortom with good health, peace, wisdom and courage as he strives in the service of Benue State and Nigeria.
