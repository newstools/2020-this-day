The PDP in a statement by the National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan reflected that the coming of Ramadan at this trying time was yet another divine signal of Allah’s love and mercy to deliver mankind from tribulations According to PDP, “Our party therefore urges all compatriots to set aside every primordial difference and unite as one people in sober reflection, prayers and support to one another in this quest to defeat the pandemic. “It is also instructive that we all use the holy month to rekindle our spirit of brotherliness by redoubling our efforts in reaching out, supporting and caring for one another, particularly the vulnerable and the downtrodden.” The PDP also called on Nigerians to continue to observe all health safety directives of social distancing and personal hygiene in the overall effort to defeat the plague and restore normalcy in our country.
