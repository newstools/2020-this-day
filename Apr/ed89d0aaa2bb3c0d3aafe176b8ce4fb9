The results show that year on year, Wema Bank has continued its steady growth trajectory. The bank recorded gross earnings of N94.89 billion which was a 32.65 per cent increase over the 2018 performance of N71.53 billion. “The bank has continued to grow its deposit base, while also reducing its cost of funds. Deposits are up by 56.35 per cent in the period. Loans and advances grew from N252.19 billion in 2018 to N289.24 billion in full year 2019, a year-on-year increase of 14.69 per cent. “The bank has also increased its dividend payment from three kobo per share to four kobo per share translating to dividend yield of eight per cent.” Ademola cautioned that, “while the results for 2019 showed very strong growth, the economic headwinds of the last few weeks has moderated our growth expectations for the next few months. It is expected that the economic and social impact of the Covid-19 virus will be far reaching. “As a bank we have also tried to play a role in supporting local and federal efforts in providing relief to those impacted directly and indirectly. According to the Wema Bank boss, this “new normal” has necessitated massive adoption of technology across the economy and we are glad that we have stayed ahead of the curve and our previous technology investments have continued to yield results. ALAT, Nigeria’s First Fully Digital Bank, continues to record strong performance as adoption rates have grown and customer base is almost at the half a million mark. We plan to continue our growth in customer acquisition and retention despite the headwinds.”
