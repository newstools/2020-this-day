The SGF, who also described the demise of the late chief of staff as a personal loss to him, added that the deceased was a good man who did a great job for Nigeria. “It is a personal loss to me, the president and to the nation. I believe Malam Abba will be remembered for so many things. He has done a great job for the nation. Malam Abba was a very good man and very determined, intellectually upright and he had a lot of foresight. “A lot of people didn’t understand Malam Abba but I worked with him for three years and I can tell you that he is a wonderful person. He is a good man; deep down in his heart, he always meant well and I looked up to him as a senior brother in the course of the work that we did in the last three years,” Mustapha said.
