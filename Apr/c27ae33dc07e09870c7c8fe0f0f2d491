A United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) licensed Flight Dispatcher and Ground Instrument, Mrs. Victoria Jumoke Adegbe, has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to review the continued shutting down of airports and other economic activities as a way of curbing the spread of COVID – 19. The Aviation Consultant and Chief Executive Officer of Insel Networks, argued that continuous lockdown would spell doom for the airline industry. She canvassed for the destruction of the screening trays at airport terminals, a development, she said provides fluid contact from one passenger to another. She proposed a ban on the use of such trays, which she noted provides contact during check in. She suggested the use of disposable trash bags to be placed at screening point and trashed after use. “The solution may not be a total lockdown when airlines are grounded and the passengers are stranded all over the world There is need to look at some things around the airport including automatic terminal doors, which opens on own accord without passengers touching any handles. Then you get to the screening point. “Here you put your carry-on in a tray for screening while you pass the screening machine empty handed. Then you pick the tray containing your personal effects, take possession of your items and the tray is picked by the officials to be used by someone else. You check in, board, not touching a single person, not assisting anyone to carry any bags for security reasons; no hugs or kisses,” she added. She attributed the spread of the virus to the use of the trays, saying most often passengers don’t touch themselves in flights. “It is the trays. Here is the solution. Throw out all the trays, better still, burn them all. Use disposable trash bags placed at screening points where you put all your items inside and trash them yourself when done. I believe that’s just what we need to do,” she said.
