Former Chelsea star, John Obi Mikel, is yet to make up his mind on the proposed move to Brazilian club, Botafogo. The 32-year-old midfielder is a free agent after ending his contract with Turkish Super Lig club Trabzonspor by mutual agreement last month. The former Super Eagles captain affirmed that the Brazilian side has shown their interest to sign him but he is yet to make a final decision. “Yes there has been interest and yes there has been negotiations but I don’t know yet. I am still thinking about it. Not sure yet,” Mikel told ESPN. Mikel has featured for Chinese Super League club Tianjin TEDA and Championship side Middlesbrough since leaving Chelsea in 2017 where he enjoyed success, besides playing in Turkey. The midfielder won the Champions League, Europa League, Premier League among other titles before his departure from Stamford Bridge. Mikel who had 89 caps for the Super Eagles, joined Trabzonspor last summer and made 27 appearances across all competitions for the Turkish side.
