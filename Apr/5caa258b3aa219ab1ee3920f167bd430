The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), Federal Operations Unit (FOU), Zone ‘A’, Ikeja has announced that its operatives have intercepted and destroyed poultry products worth N20.6 million. Acting Controller of the unit, Usman Yahaya, in a statement issued in Lagos by the unit’s Public Relations Officer, Jerry Attah, explained that the seizures, which came in 2,154 cartons in seven different vehicles were made in two separate operations within one week. Yahaya, stated that his men have sustained round the clock patrols while keeping to safe distance rules in line with COVID-19 prevention techniques.
“These seizures, which we made within a week is a strong message to smugglers and trans border criminals. They should not be deceived into concluding that we are away from our duty posts. As usual, we are on duty and will continue to surprise smugglers with seizures and arrests any time they dare us. “These seizures were contained in seven vehicles that were quickly abandoned by the drivers who fled on sighting our officers. We had to improvise means of driving the vehicles to our premises because the smugglers ran away with the keys,” he said. Highest bulk of the seizure, he disclosed, was achieved by a patrol team led by a Chief Superintendent of Customs, Steven Abah, whose team brought in 1500 cartons in a swoop.
