Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq of Kwara State has directed the 193 wards across the state to form their own committees to deepen enlightenment on the COVID-19 pandemic and own the campaign against community transmission of the virus. Chief Press Secretary (CPS), to the governor, Mr. Rafiu Ajakaye, said this in a statement issued yesterday in Ilorin. “The governor says the time calls for everyone to take responsibility for our collective safety. “He, therefore, encourages all the wards in the state to form their own COVID-19 committees. “They can pattern their own committees after the template already established at the state level. “They can have various subcommittees especially in the area of public enlightenment on COVID-19, how to prevent its spread, and how to support those who are the hardest hit by the stay-at-home directive in their areas,” Ajakaye said. The statement said the main focus was for the people to take ownership of the campaign against the spread of the virus in their respective communities and areas of influence. Ajakaye added that AbdulRazaq commended the Offa Descendants Union (ODU) and Alanamu Ward for establishing their own COVID-19 committees to support the government. “We want to see this initiative replicated across the state. We all need to take responsibility for our health. “We commend ODU and Alanamu Ward for their pro-activeness. This has helped to deepen awareness in these areas. “Government is very pleased with the development. It is commendable,” the statement added.
