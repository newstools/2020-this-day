Abia Warriors goalkeeper Charles Tambe is currently receiving treatment at the University Teaching Hospital (UCH), Ibadan after he was shot by thugs on Friday. Tambe returned to Ibadan to reunite with his family following the suspension of the Nigeria Professional Football League due to the coronavirus pandemic. According to the statement issued by Abia Warriors’ sporting director Patrick Ngwaogwu, the former Shooting Stars and Lobi Stars goalkeeper was shot on his way for his morning exercise routine. “He is not a rascal. He went for his morning walk out at about 07:00 this morning in Apata area, Ibadan where he stays with his family,” Ngwaogwu said, per BSN Sport. “They accosted him and collected his wristwatch and handset. And shot him on the hand.
“He is presently in UCH, receiving treatment. The club is very much on top of the situation.” Tambe joined the Umuahia-based outfit last September, and he recently appeared in a video posted by the club urging fans to stay safe amid the Covid-19 pandemic.
