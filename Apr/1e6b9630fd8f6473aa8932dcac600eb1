The federal government has said there is no date yet for schools to resume despite the announcement by President Muhammadu Buhari relaxing the lockdown on the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Lagos and Ogun states. The government also said the West African Examinations Council (WAEC) had not cancelled its external exams as students would still take those exams when normalcy has been restored. The Minister of State for Education, Mr. Emeka Nwajiuba, said this while replying to a question during yesterday’s briefing by the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 pandemic. Also at the press conference, the National Coordinator on PTF COVID-19, Dr. Sani Aliyu, said PTF was also working with the Nigerian Governors’ Forum and would be willing to share the draft of the implementation guidelines with the forum, communicating the guidelines on the phased easing of the lockdown. According to him, the move is also to ensure that the governors are aware of what PTF is proposing in order to have synergy on the lockdown. He, however, said it would not be necessary to conduct COVID-19 test for drivers going across state boundaries, noting that doing that would imply NCDC would have to more staff across all the states to make sure everybody is being tested as they cross.
