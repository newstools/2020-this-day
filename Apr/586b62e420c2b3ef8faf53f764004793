By George Okoh On the occasion of this year’s Easter, Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom has urged the people of Benue to pray for the state, Nigeria and the entire world for a speedy end to Coronavirus pandemic. Governor Ortom admonishes all Christians and Muslims to pray and seek the intervention of Almighty God in the fight against COVID-19 which is ravaging parts of the globe. He stated that with God, nothing was impossible, as it is written in the book of 2 Chronicles 7:14, “If my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land.” Governor Ortom says the death and resurrection of Jesus should draw his followers closer to God so they can appreciate the abundant grace and mercy of God upon their lives. He urges the people to eschew bitterness and differences, unite and show love to one another at this trying moment in human history. He urges families to mark this year’s Easter celebration indoors, to avoid coming in close contact with others, in line with the directive on social distancing. The governor equally stressed the need for people to adhere to hand washing, use of sanitisers and other preventive measures against COVID-19. He says owing to increasing cases of the virus in the country, it is in the best interest of all Benue people that the closure of public places such as markets and worship centres as well as the 7pm to 6am curfew continue, with the assurance that government’s assessment of the situation will determine the next line of action. Governor Ortom appeals that though the measures taken to prevent the spread of Coronavirus in the state are painful, the approach is necessary as the sacrifice that must be made by all Benue people. He notes that even as no fresh case of the disease has been found in Benue, it is important that the people continue to support government directive.
