Kuni Tyessi in Abuja In its efforts to help fight the spread of COVID-19, the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has donated two ventilators to the University of Abuja Teaching Hospital in Gwagwalada and one to the principal hospital in the Board’s host community, the Bwari General Hospital, in preparation for any eventuality. In a statement signed by the Board’s spokesperson, Dr. Fabian Benjamin, JAMB decision was borne out of the desire to plan in line with the federal government’s determination to ensure that no Nigerian succumbed to the virus. He said the donation of the ventilators which cost millions of naira is to strategically place the hospitals in good stead to give necessary treatment to COVID-19 patients whether in Bwari or any other part of Abuja. “These are indeed difficult times for all Nigerians as we collectively battle to contain the spread of COVID-19. It is in the light of this that JAMB is urging all prospective tertiary institutions intakes, students, parents and indeed the entire country to support the government by abiding by all instructions aimed at fighting the spread of the pandemic. “Furthermore, the Board appreciates the support and donations from corporate bodies and individuals towards complementing government’s efforts aimed at containing the spread of the pandemic as well as treating those already infected with the virus. “However, this gesture was in addition to the several other interventions aimed at aiding the fight against the virus. “JAMB will continue to support the fight against the pandemic within its limited means and by so doing, protect our teeming candidates who are the hopes of the future,” he said.
