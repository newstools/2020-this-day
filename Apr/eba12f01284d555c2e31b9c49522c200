Market analysts said some discerning investors found the Nigerian equities market very attractive due to low valuations, hence the increased value of investment in Q1 of 2020. Investment banking firm, Afrinvest (West Africa) had urged investors to take advantage of the bearish situation and increase their investments. “With a loss of 17.3 per cent YTD, market valuation is currently weak at 6.7x P/E ratio (vs. 8.9x average in January 2020), which is at its lowest since 2015. Given the effectiveness of social distancing measures to fighting the spread of COVID-19 and its wide adoption in countries most vulnerable to the virus, we could see a resumption of economic activities in second half of 2020 which would support crude oil prices and market performance. Thus, we advise a gradual entry approach (buying in tranches) into the Nigerian equities market given the uncertainties both on the global and domestic fronts,” they said.
