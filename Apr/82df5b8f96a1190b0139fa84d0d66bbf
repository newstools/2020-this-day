She leans over And kisses him gently on the forehead Her heart is heavy This may be the last time They will share physical contact A tiny sob escapes From her constricted throat A single tear streams down her cheeks Dropping gently on his cheeks Stirring him into a sleepy murmur Her closeness and familiar fragrance Eliciting a smile on his face From deep within the world of slumber She has to leave Now There are lives to save The dark clouds are growing And hers may be One of the sacrificial offerings To appease the raging gods Like a soldier going to war She steels her resolution This is the culmination Of all her training This is the truest test Of her own humanity The world is enveloped in darkness Humbled by a primordial fear Even though the sun blazes at noon Despair rents the air And the minds of men lose hope The gift of time Just became more precious Happy memories Even more treasured She will not give in to the panic She must not She has a quest to fulfil This is her destiny Quietly she joins the line One of the torch bearers Assigned to restore hope And bring light To the hearts of men Posterity is a heavy burden She carries her lit torch Marching forward Crying for the loved ones She may never see again Cheered by the many lives She may yet save And bring to light Comforted by the knowledge That either she survives or dies She would have left the world A better place A safer place For the many Who knew not her name And the few Who loved it intimately ( Poet: Femi Onakanren. Poetry inspired by the lives of selfless health workers in the fight against Covid-19)
