So, we must unite together and confront it collectively so that we can end it and have a state and a country we call our own ” It is after the victory over the deadly coronvirus scourage that we can start to think of politics again, I’m a loyal member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the core, I’m not for that for now, I have to think how I can contribute my own little quota for the well being of my people” The lawmaker who is also the Chairman of the House Committee on Public Accounts urged the people of the state and Nigerians in general not to panic about the dreaded pandemic, but rather to observe all necessary precautionary instructions from relevant government agencies and experts, adding that with collective efforts by all and sundry, the deadly coronvirus would soon be history.
