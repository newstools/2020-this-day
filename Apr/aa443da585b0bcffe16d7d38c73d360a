This was disclosed in a statement yesterday by the spokesman of the academy, Maj. Abubakar Abdullahi. He said the design and production of the ventilators came a week after the Commandant NDA, Maj. General Jamil Sarham, convened a team of engineers, technologists and technicians from the Mechatronics Department headed by Major Abubakar Imam to “rapidly develop affordable ventilator within the shortest possible time, using readily available components.” According to the statement, the team was also tasked to “develop capacity of producing at least 30 ventilators in a month.” Presenting their report to the Commandant, Imam, head of the team who is also Head of Department Mechatronics, said the team was able to produce two unique ventilators within a week and could be quickly deployed to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The statement explained that both ventilators, “NDA Type 1 and NDA Type 2,” could be reproduced cheaply, adding that currently, the Academy had the capacityThe statement said both prototypes had been subjected to series of technical performance evaluation tests with impressive results. “It is worthy to know that apart from the production of the ventilators, the NDA also produced hand wash and sanitisers.
