The Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria (PSN), Lagos State, has demanded an all-inclusive Primary Healthcare Board with representatives of the PSN, Association of Community Pharmacists of Nigeria (ACPN) and Medical and Health Workers Union of Nigeria (MHWUN) accommodated to strengthen the healthcare system in the state. Chairman of Lagos Chapter of PSN, Gbolagade Iyiola, in a document presented to the Council on Health, Lagos State Government, at the 2020 Annual Summit of the Lagos chapter of PSN; advised the government to recognise Community Pharmacies as primary care centres in immunisation services, ante-natal clinics, family planning, health promotion, health and wellness services and overall patient empowerment. He said government at all levels must begin to invest significantly into Primary Healthcare with emphasis on preventive therapy through maximum engagement of environmental health officers. “It is a statement of fact that governments at all levels must tinker with their budgets to feature preventive care therapy at the expense of curative therapy. A renaissance/rescue team by LASG needs to drive this agenda,” said Iyiola. He further said, “Healthcare is a globally inclined endeavour driven by international best practice and was the reason for each health professional specialising all over the world.” The PSN Chairman urged Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu to initiate a programme of action to avail all trainee health workers the benefit of facilities in the state. “In the quest to open the restricted borders of progression in healthcare in Nigeria, we strongly urge His Excellency Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to direct unhindered access of training facilities to all health workers in training at undergraduate and post-graduate levels,” he said.
