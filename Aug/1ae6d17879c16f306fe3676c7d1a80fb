Loud Whispers with Joseph Edgar In continuation of my series of shouting out to Nigerians doing well, let me say hello to this my brother. He is the major promoter at Cruxstone, a real estate platform that is doing well. During this lockdown, the man unlike some that I know continued to meet his obligations to his subscribers who had put money down to deliver iconic towers, one of the most pristine developments coming up on Victoria Island. I personally saw the hit he took with the Exchange rate volatility, lockdown and the wahala they face from authorities. But he has stayed the course, not sacking one person and meeting all of his obligations to all concerned. A true Nigerian, I say well done, sir. We are watching to emulate. God bless.
