Seriki Adinoyi in Jos The embattled former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Dr. Obadiah Mailafia has resigned his appointment with the National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies (NIPSS) in Kuru, Plateau State Until his resignation, Mailafia was a Director at the National Institute, Nigeria’s think-tank institution. Counsel to the former apex bank’s deputy governor, Mr. Yakubu Bawa confirmed the development to THISDAY in a text message, but did not give further details on it. He said, “Yes, it is true that my client, Dr. Mailafia has resigned his appointment with NIPSS.” Investigations revealed that his resignation may not be unconnected with the developments since the controversial interview he granted Nigeria Info FM on some security issues in the country and the killings in Southern Kaduna. He had on Monday, approached the High Court of Plateau State to declare his latest invitation by the Nigeria Police Force to Force Headquarters, Abuja as unconstitutional, unlawful, illegal, and ultra vires, with no legal effect whatsoever. Bawa had said that Mailafia’s invitation by the Police over the issues the DSS was already investigating contravenes the law of the land, stressing that his client was not going to honour the Police invitation, which he described as strange and alien to Nigeria’s extant laws and procedures.
