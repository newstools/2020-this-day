Afri-Goal foundation has condemned yesterday’s arrest and clampdown on peaceful protesters in Nigeria. The organisation said in a statement that the development was not only an abuse of power by the Nigerian police and military but also a gross violation of the constitutionally guaranteed right of the protesters. “The Constitution of Nigeria recognised the right to peaceful protest and we urged the police and all other power-drunken officials to respect this fundamental right of the people. We demand the immediate and unconditional release of all protesters arrested today in Lagos, Abuja, Osun, Ondo and other states where protest action took place. Afri-Goal also asked the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration to immediately release all those who are illegally detained and those undergoing different trumped-up charges.
