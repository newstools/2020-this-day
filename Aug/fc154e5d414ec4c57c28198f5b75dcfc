This latest initiative is part of the efforts by SHIN to contribute to the development of the welding industry in Nigeria, and to empower Nigerian youth by training them in skills that are high in demand for a rapidly developing country. According to a statement issued by CSR, entrants for the Worldskills Olympic will be carefully selected through a National Welding Contest– the first ever in Nigeria. The event will be organised by SHIN, in collaboration with NIW. SHIN will also contribute further through donations to the entrants and to the contest itself. The memorandum of agreement marking this collaboration is to be signed at the end of this month. This is newest addition to the already existing efforts made by SHIN to contribute to the development of the welding Industry in Nigeria, and to empower Nigerian youth by training them in skills that are high in demand for a rapidly developing country. The company stated that it wants to involve young talent in the future of the country and create a window of limitless opportunity for Nigerians. “Active participation in such events also goes a long way in redirecting focus on the country, allowing Nigeria to compete with other countries in the world. Given the current uncertainties around events, if the National Welding Contest does indeed take place in November as planned, SHIN will also provide the facility at its Welding Qualification Centre as the venue of the contest, free of charge, “ the statement explained. Thirty six promising participants will first be selected from the tertiary institutions in Nigeria to enter the National Welding Competition 2021.
