By Ernest Chinwo Thousands of members and supporters of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Etche Local Government Area of Rivers State led by Chief Ambrose Igbokwe Nwuzi, the Ogbugaa 1 of Etche Nation, yesterday defected to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Addressing the defectors, the state Governor, Nyesom Wike, urged PDP leaders in the area to work together for the overall interest of their people. Wike said he made a promise to reconcile all aggrieved members of the party during his second term inauguration, and would not allow further divisions in the party. He called on the leader of the party in Etche LGA, Prince Emma Anyanwu, to carry all members of the party along in the scheme of things. According to Wike, “The people of Etche ethnic nationality have lost a lot of things because of division. You should see the overall interest of Etche far above personal interests. “I have embarked on developmental projects in Etche, including the Olakwo-Afara-Nihi Road, even when Chief Ambrose Nwuzi was in APC. “We shall provide more people-oriented projects in your area during the lifespan of this administration.” He commend Nwuzi for taking the bold step to return to the PDP, and urged the people to understand that the development of Etche is more paramount. Receiving the defectors to the party, the state Chairman of the PDP, Desmond Akawor, said the return of Nwuzi to the party was prompted by the developmental strides of the governor across the state devoid of ethnic and political sentiments. Akawor stated that with the defection of Nwuzi to the PDP, there is no more APC in Etche LGA. In his speech, Chief Nwuzi apologised to the people of Etche for what he described as his sabbatical journey to the APC. He described APC as a party of unfulfilled promises, noting that with his return to the PDP, there would be massive defection to the party in the coming days.
