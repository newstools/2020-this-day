By Mary Nnah Worried by the deplorable state of most Nigerian dancers occasioned by lack of future plans by these dancers, a popular Nigerian stage dancer and Executive Director, Ice Production, Ice Nnamdi Nweke, has concluded plans to launch a virtual dance convention tagged, Dance Convention – Dance Education (DC-DE), an initiative aimed at providing education and empowerment to the Nigerian dancers in the dance growing industry. Scheduled to hold from August 18 to 20, 2020, the three-day virtual event is free for all participants irrespective of age. Also, seven international dance teachers are on board the project. Also, three top Nigeria dance teachers, Surprise Jakande, Nas & Smack and Victor Phullu, will be teaching alongside the international teachers while 11 keynote speakers based in Nigeria would cover the area of Finance, marketing, business, branding and fundraising. Also to be featured is Founder/CEO of Green Essence Healthy Lifestyle, Ms Chiamaka Oragwu, who will be taking participants on healthy living. Addressing newsmen in Lagos on Thursday, Nweke said: “It may be of interest to know that with only five performing arts schools, 17 theatre arts schools and a few dance studios catering for the education of the teaming population of dancers in Nigeria, who are mostly teenagers and youths, the education of dancers – youths who form the bulk of the over 200 million population of Nigeria – and the possibility to stay gainfully employed is increasingly slim with each passing day; more so with the consequent shut down of the industry due to the pandemic.” He said therefore that the future of the next generation, the talents and the endless possibilities for success needs to be preserved, sustained and aligned to our emerging economy. “There seems to be no better ways to strategically position ourselves for what the future of our nation holds after the pandemic than the long proven legacy of education, empowerment, gainful collaborations and investments that would initiate projects, seminars and conventions to the benefit of the greatest percentage of our nation’s teaming population of youths”, Nweke noted. He said further that the main objective of DC-DE is to bridge the gap by organising annual convention with aims of teaching, training, empowering and equipping dancers with necessary tools that will enable them thrive in the world’s fast changing economy
