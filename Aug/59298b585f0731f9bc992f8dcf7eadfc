Ibrahim Shuaibu in Kano The Kano State chapter of the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) has directed its members to sell fuel for N150 per litre. The directive was contained in a statement issued by the state IPMAN Chairman, Bashir Danmallam, a copy of which was made available to journalists in Kano yesterday. The IPMAN chairman said the directive followed the new price modulation announced by the Petroleum Products Marketing Company (PPMC), and has accordingly instructed its members to comply by selling the product at N150 per litre. According to him, the directive was also in compliance with the government’s earlier statement that it would review upward or downward the price of the commodity on a monthly basis depending on the price at the international market. Recall that the PPMC had in a memo signed by its Manager Sales, Mohammed Bello, on August 4, 2020, fixed the depot price of petrol at N138. 62 per litre. “Please be informed that the management has approved ex-depot price of petroleum products, including petrol, at N138. 62 per litre,” the memo said. Similarly, he said the private depots had also increased their price as they would sell the commodity to their members at N139. 5 per litre. Danmallam asked all members under his jurisdiction to comply with the new price regime by making sure no one sells above the approved ceiling of N150 per litre. He assured the public of the availability of petroleum products at all times.
