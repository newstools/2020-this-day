An audit report carried out by the the Imo State Secondary Education Management Board (IMSUBEB) has revealed that not less than 60 dead persons in the agency were still receiving salary till date. The report also shows that several persons who were 60 years and above the age of retirement were still drawing salary while more than 40 staff of the agency who absconded from service were being payrolled. The shocking revelation was made at the weekend when the committee set up by the Agency of Imo State Government to look into its activities submitted its report to Governor Hope Uzodimma. Receiving the report, Uzodimma lauded the agency for the courage to carry out the audit and encouraged other ministries and agencies of government to do likewise for the purpose of sanitising the payroll system of the state. “No amount of distraction will deter government from completing the automation exercise. It is unfortunate that agents of opposition party keep trying to blackmail the government. Unfortunately, I will not allow them to have their way,” the governor said. The Governor said his administration was committed to the payment of salary and emoluments of civil servants and pensioners and urged those yet to receive their pay to approach the relevant offices with the appropriate data so that they could be payrolled in line with the automation process. He regretted that leaders of the protesting pensioners like Collins Ohaneje had received his pension pay up till date, yet creates impression that government had not paid pensioners or not ready to pay them at all. The governor pleaded with the pensioners who were yet to receive their pay to exercise patience as the government did not have the intention to leave any of them out who deserve to be paid.
