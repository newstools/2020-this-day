The NNPC report said the 109 per cent rise in revenue in the month under review was the cumulative result of improved performances by some of the corporation’s Strategic Business Units (SBUs) It said: “While the Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC) posted a surplus due to substantial growth in the market fundamentals as demand began a slight recovery; the Nigerian Gas Marketing Company (NGMC) recorded 257 per cent increased profit attributed to improved debt collection. “Similarly, PPMC’s surplus rose 250 per cent from investment dividend received and significant drop in average product landing cost. In addition, corporate headquarters deficit ebbed by 47 per cent in May, compared to last month’s. “NNPC Retail, Integrated Data Services Limited (IDSL), NNPC Shipping and Ventures also contributed positively to the month’s performance, leading to the significant NNPC group surplus position during the period under review.”
