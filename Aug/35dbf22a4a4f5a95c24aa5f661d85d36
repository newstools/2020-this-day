Techvibes International Limited has introduced estate303.com, which is a free real estate listing platform that integrates key players in the sector into one huge marketplace. The innovation is expected to significantly reduce turnaround time from listing to renting, leasing or buying properties. Managing Director/Chief Executive of the company, Mr. Michael Oglegba, said, “Investors, home buyers and apartment seekers, agents, builders, and developers will find the website as a haven for information regarding real estate.” He said the platform was uniquely positioned to deliver value, excellent service, access to markets and offer unrivalled advantages. According to him: “Looking for property to buy or rent or letting out a property can be frustrating for all landlords, tenants and agents. Many have lost funds to fraudsters or given out houses to difficult tenants. Agents have walked away with Landlords funds and legal fees have been known to fluctuate.” In a statement, the company stated that estate303, “gives real value to real estate. Property owners and brokers can list properties, view their portfolios, track transactions, appraise tenants and more, while tenants and buyers can view hundreds of listings, with each containing detailed descriptions, pictures and walkthrough videos. “You do not have to leave the comfort of your home to find a property to rent, lease or buy. Property owners can list their properties at no cost and have the option of allowing the estate303 team manage such afterwards. “Properties managed by Estate303 allow for flexible payments for rent, lease or outright purchase. The platform allows for automated monthly, quarterly, biannual and annual payments with automated reports and profiles buyers for possible financing.”
