Premium lager beer, Hero, has unveiled a promo initiative “Rise like a Hero” to reward its teeming customers. Marketing Director of International Breweries, Tolulope Adedeji, stated that the initiative was put out to appreciate customers who have been consistent with the brand. She said that the time of the promo was deliberate and strategic to cushion the effect of COVID-19 on individuals and businesses, adding that the initiative was in line with the firm’s values and hopes to inspire people. “When we launched Hero into the Nigerian market eight years ago, we were sure that the product will do well. Today, our expectations have not only been met but also surpassed due to the unalloyed support of our numerous consumers. “We have therefore decided to demonstrate our appreciation by giving back to our partners. We consider our consumers partners on this journey as Hero is all about them and their satisfaction. Over the next couple of weeks, our customers will have an opportunity to win airtime and cash prize, while they enjoy their favourite beer, so it’s a win-win for them. The Rise Like a Hero Consumer Promo is geared towards celebrating and rewarding the hero that lives in every Nigerian.” The ‘Rise like a Hero’ gives consumers a chance to win cash prizes of N10,000 and N50,000 through an E-draw while grand prize winners of N1,000,000 will emerge weekly. The activity will also see consumers win instant airtime when they send the number under Hero crown to a short message code or via a designated promo website.
