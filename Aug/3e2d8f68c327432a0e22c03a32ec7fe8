By Kemi Olaitan As part of its commitment to improve customer experience, the Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company Plc (IBEDC), has created 13 new Customer Care Offices in Ogun State. The Chief Operating Officer (COO), of the company, Engr. John Ayodele, in a release made available to THISDAY, said the newly created offices are to ensure easier accessibility and convenience for customers, stating that this would lead to stronger interactions/feedback and facilitate robust / quick responses to customers’ enquiries and complaints. Ayodele, while speaking at the launch of the offices, noted that the expansion of its customer care offices was a deliberate attempt to bring services closer to the customers. He said “As a customer-oriented company, we are constantly developing initiatives and services that deliberately bring us closer to the customers, right where they live or do business.” He explained that the offices are strategically located across Ogun state – Owode-Yewa, Itele, Ilogbo, Magboro, Ogijo, Ilaro, Ifo, Mowe, Imo, Ago- Iwoye, Ijebu- Ife, Ashimolowo and Olumo communities He said the offices are located far from the regional office at Abeokuta to remove the stress of travelling long distances to get complaints resolved, urging customers to take advantage of the Customer Care office nearest to them to enjoy better and faster service. Ayodele added that the creation of the Customer Care offices was the first phase of the initiative across its franchise.
