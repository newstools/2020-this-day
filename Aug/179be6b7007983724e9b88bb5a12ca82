You see, people are different in this world o. That is how I will be ranting on WhatsApp to my over 10,000 followers. I will be talking about all and any issue that catches my fancy. Some yeye people will be blocking me but will also be asking me at night to send a naked woman picture to them. But this talented award-winning dancer was quietly collating all my rants and came out with beautiful production. Kai, he invited me to come and see the play. Come and see the action. Six heavenly handsome boys playing Joseph Edgar and taking me through small snippets of my life, discussing very strong issues. The part that got me was when I had written about the time I prayed that Chantal my daughter marry a man like me and the Duchess said God forbid! In anger, I went out to sleep in the car hoping that someone will come and beg me. After two hours it dawned on me that nobody was coming to beg, I humbly enter the house. Thank you so much, Segun. The production was mad… Can’t wait to see it at the Muson.
