We completed the Nigerian asset acquisition in November 2019, which transformed Savannah into a highly cash flow generative full cycle energy company. “Since acquiring the Nigerian assets, we have made significant strides in terms of operational and financial progress, as seen with the strong production figures and robust cash collections in the first half of 2020, further strengthened our leadership team and stand poised to capitalise on the numerous opportunities that our asset portfolio in Nigeria and Niger presents us with. “In the first half of 2020, cash collections from the Nigerian assets stood at $82.1 million compared to $55.3 million within the same period in 2019. Average gross daily production, of which 89 per cent was gas, increased 18 per cent during the first half of 2020 to 21.3 Kboepd compared to 18.1 Kboepd in 2018.” Savannah Energy said its operations in Nigeria have seen it make significant contribution to power supply in the country.” It added: “Accugas’ customers achieved an all-time record peak contribution of 11.5 per cent of Nigeria’s electricity generation or 486MW on 23 May 2020, with the contributed electricity being exclusively generated from Accugas sales gas.
