The downstream subsidiary of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), the Petroleum Products Marketing Company (PPMC), has fixed the ex-depot price of petrol, at N138.62 per litre. The ex-depot price is the price at which depot owners sell the commodity to retail outlets. In recent times, the ex-depot price per litre of petrol is normally around N15 lower than the pump price, as the marketers would add cost of transporting the commodity from the depots to their retail outlets, in addition to other costs, such as marketersâ€™ margin among others. In a memo in Abuja, signed by Manager, Sales, PPMC, Mr. Mohammed Bello, disclosed that the new price would come into effect from August 5, 2020. The PPMC put the ex-coastal price of the commodity, which is the price at which the product is sold to depot owners, at N113.70 per litre. The PPMC also put the Ex-depot price for diesel, at N160 per litre and N165 per litre, for depots in Lagos and Oghara respectively, while ex-depot price for kerosene was put at N160 per litre. It is expected that oil marketers would adjust their pump price to between N145 to N155 per litre.
