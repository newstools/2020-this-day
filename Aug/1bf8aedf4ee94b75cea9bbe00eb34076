StarTimes has lined up exciting top-flight soccer events to the delight of football fans. In terms of European events, StarTimes, the exclusive broadcaster of the UEFA Europa League, will broadcast the semi-final matches between Sevilla and Manchester United on Sunday at 8 pm; while Inter Milan will battle Shakhtar Donetsk on Monday at 8 pm. The final will be played on August 21. Manchester United’s pace is something Sevilla must be wary of heading into their semi-final, according to Sevilla captain, Jesus Navas. Navas spent four seasons playing for Manchester City in between spells at Sevilla and is no stranger to the Red Devils. From September 3, StarTimes will air the UEFA Nations League. The second edition of UEFA’s newest national-team competition will begin with great clashes such as Germany vs. Spain, Sweden against France and titleholder Portugal vs Croatia. The digital TV operator recently acquired LaLiga broadcasting rights (French commentary). The exciting Spanish league will be shown on the StarTimes sports channels starting from the first 20120/21 season matchday on September 12. StarTimes will also broadcast other European Cups like the Coppa Italia, exclusive in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Spanish Copa del Rey and The Emirates FA Cup, among others.
