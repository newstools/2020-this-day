Edinson Cavani has rejected a summer move to Juventus due to his loyalty and affection for former club Napoli, according to reports. The 33-year-old frontman departed Paris Saint-Germain as a free agent at the end of last season and is currently searching for his next challenge. But Sky Sports Italia claim that Cavani has snubbed the opportunity to become part of Andrea Pirlo’s rebuild in Turin and will instead look elsewhere. Cavani scored 104 goals in 138 matches during his spell with Napoli between 2010 and 2013, which also saw him win the Coppa Italia during his first campaign. He has since been linked with a host of European clubs after it became clear he would run down his deal and walk away from the French capital. A switch to Benfica reportedly collapsed due to Cavani’s wage demands. It has been suggested that the Uruguay international wanted a three-year deal worth £8.8million per season, an exorbitant figure which ultimately proved out of reach for the Portuguese giants. Real Madrid are also thought to hold interest in Cavani. It has been reported that the LaLiga champions thrashed out personal terms with the prolific ace in January, but the deal failed to materialise due to PSG’s £27m price tag. Cavani was said to have been ‘enthusiastic’ about the prospect of heading to Madrid, and still remains without a new club.
