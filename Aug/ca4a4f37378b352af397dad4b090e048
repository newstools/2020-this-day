By Laleye Dipo Following the increasing spate of bandits’ attacks and suggestions by major stakeholders on how to check the trend, the Nigeria Army is now to establish a super camp in bandit-infested parts of Niger State. Senator Sani Musa had been in the forefront of the call for the establishment of such camps in his senatorial district, where bandits have been operating with reckless abandon, saying that such facilities would give security operatives opportunities to promptly respond to distress calls when attacked by bandits. Governor Abubakar Sani Bello, in a statement made available to newsmen in Minna by his Chief Press Secretary Mary Noel Berje on Thursday, disclosed the decision of the army to set up the camp when he and his counterpart in Kaduna State, Nasir el-Rufai, visited the Army Super Camp 4 in Kaduna State. “I am also made to understand that more camps are coming up, one in Niger State which I believe will go a long way towards addressing these challenges,” Governor Bello said in the statement. Bello is of the opinion that with such camps in place, the environment will be secured and safe for the inhabitants, thereby making life and farming activities return to normal as those mostly affected are rural dwellers. He said following the briefs they received from the Chief of Army Staff (CAS), Lt Gen. Tukur Burutai, the Operation Sahel has brought sanity to towns and villages that were under the control of bandits and kidnappers. The governor expressed gratitude to President Muhammadu Buhari for approving the establishment of the Sahel Operation, saying that the president has shown seriousness and determination to check banditry and other forms of criminality across the country. Governor Bello also commended officers and men of the Nigeria Army for their resilience in bringing succour to the local communities in the North-west and part of the North-central geo political zones of the country and also prayed for the repose of the soul of those who had lost their lives in the defence of their fatherland.
