Queens Park Rangersare hoping to spark a bidding war between Crystal Palaceand West Hamover forward Eberechi Eze. Palace have had an offer in the region of £12million knocked back for the 22-year-old who QPR value at around £20million. The Championship side need to sell for financial reasons but are confident that – given the strength of interest from Palace and West Ham – they can hike the price before agreeing a deal. West Brom are also interested but the two London clubs are at the front of the queue for Eze. Both Palace and West Ham are keen to add youth to their squads ahead of next season. Palace, who had the oldest squad in the Premier Leaguelast season, have already added 19-year-old full-back Nathan Ferguson on a free transfer. Eze has entered the final year of his contract and this summer transfer window represents QPR’s last real chance of securing a mammoth price unless they can persuade him to sign a new contract. The former Millwall man has dazzled for a mid-table Championship team, scoring 14 goals and providing eight assists from QPR’s 46 league matches this season. Crystal Palace made an enquiry for Eze late in the January window after losing out to West Ham in the race for Jarrod Bowen. The QPR man is so highly rated that the club’s director of football Les Ferdinand even tipped him to make the England squad for next summer’s European Championships. Meanwhile, Moyes went to The Kiyan Prince Foundation Stadium in the final weeks of the season to cast his eye over Eze and believes the successful signing of Jarrod Bowen in January has provided a blueprint to follow.
