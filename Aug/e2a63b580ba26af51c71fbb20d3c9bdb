Chelseastar Willian has reportedly agreed a three-year contract worth Â£100,000 per week with Arsenal. The 31-year-old was locked in talks over fresh terms to remain at Stamford Bridge, but has chosen to move on after Chelsea refused to offer him the long-term deal he had demanded. Two years were on the table but the player wanted three. Frank Lampardwas keen to retain Willian and extend his seven-year spell in West London, but Arsenal have stepped in to seal the deal on a free transfer.
