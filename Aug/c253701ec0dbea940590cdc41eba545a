The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has approved the payment of August salary and pension, restating his commitment to workers and pensioners’ welfare. In a statement, Special Adviser to the Governor on Media and Communication Strategy, Mr. Crusoe Osagie, said the governor gave the directive in line with the standing order for prompt payment of salary and pension obligations to workers. According to him, “We are glad, as always, to report that August salary and pension have been paid in line with the directive of the governor, whose financial sagacity has kept the state’s economy healthy despite shocks from the internal and external environments. “Last month, salaries and pension even came earlier because of the Sallah celebrations. Much as this is a statutory duty of government, we must also note that it is a time when a lot of states are in dire straits amid the adverse economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and the lull in revenue, due to low crude oil prices.”
