Ibrahim Shuaibu in Kano The Kano State Government has constituted a committee to assess the five Kilometers dual carriageway projects in 44 local governments of the state that were awarded by the administration of a former Governor of Kano State, Mr. Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso. The State Commissioner for Information, Mr. Muhammad Garba, disclosed this yesterday when he briefed journalists on the outcome of the council meeting that was held at the Africa House, Kano. Garba explained that the committee would be chaired by the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Works and Infrastructure with representatives from the Kano Urban Planning and Development Authority (KNUPDA) and ministry for local government. The committee, according to him, would also determine the extent of the execution of the projects and payment made to the contractors handling the projects. He revealed that the council has already terminated the contract awarded to Rocad Construction Nigeria Limited in 2012 for the construction of the five kilometers dual carriageway in Dawakin Tofa Local Government Area. The commissioner said the council has re-awarded the contract to Messrs. CCECC Nigeria Limited at the cost of N651, 844, 966.51 million after Rocad has abandoned work and exposed the residents of the area to many hardships. It should be recalled that most of the dual carriage ways that were awarded by Kwankwasoâ€™s administration in each of the 44 local governments of the state are yet to be completed five years after the end of his tenure. The relationship between Kwankwaso and the incumbent Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje became sour immediately after Kwankwaso helped Ganduje to become governor in 2015.
