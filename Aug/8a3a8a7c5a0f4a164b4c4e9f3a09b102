The Sultan of Sokoto, Saad Abubakar, yesterday visited Kaduna State Governor, Malam Nasir El-Rufai over the killings in the southern part of the state. The governor disclosed this via his verified Twitter handle. “Malam Nasir El-Rufai has welcomed His Eminence, the Sultan of Sokoto, who is on a private visit to Sir Kashim Ibrahim House,” @GovKaduna wrote. Yesterday’s visit comes barely 24 hours after Sunday’s visit by the deposed Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi ll. Though the purpose of the Sultan’s visit was yet to be disclosed, it was gathered that it was not unconnected to the killings in the southern part of the state. Although the Sultan declined to speak to reporters after the meeting, El-Rufai said the meeting discussed the security challenges in southern Kaduna and other parts of the state. The governor disclosed that he received advice and encouragement from the royal father towards finding a lasting solution to the security challenges in the state. He appreciated the Sultan for his fatherly visit and support in ensuring that peace returns to the state. Kaduna has been experiencing a series of attacks with a recent one carried out six weeks ago.
