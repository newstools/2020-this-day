By Seriki Adinoyi Following his revelation on Boko Haram insurgents in Nigeria, and allegation of the involvement of a serving northern governor, a former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Dr. Obadiah Mailafia was yesterday quizzed for six hours by the Department of Security Services (DSS) in Jos and later released on bail. Mailafia arrived at the DSS office located on West of Mines Street around 12:30 pm in an ash-coloured Range Rover vehicle marked: Abuja 843 LX and was later released a few minutes past 6pm. On arrival at the DSS, he was ushered into one of the offices alongside his lawyer, Mr. Pius Akubo (SAN), while other people who came with him in solidarity were barred from entering the premises. Speaking to journalists shortly after his release, Mailafia said he was treated with respect and decorum during his interrogation by the security operatives, warning that all the killings in southern Kaduna and indeed other states in the country must stop. He said that every Nigerian child either from Daura in Katsina or Manchok , in Kaduna must be treated with respect they deserve, as they are all Nigerians, adding that he was not talking politics, but like Nelson Mandela, he was in the struggle for the emancipation of the
people. He noted that it is the duty of the government to protect the lives and property of its citizens, adding that “I’m not afraid to die for the sake of the defenceless people.” He commended his well-wishers that have been praying for him, urging them not to give up on one Nigeria, and stressing that his stand on national issues has never been negotiable.
