By Kingsley Nwezeh President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday inaugurated the newly established Police Mobile Force (PMF) Training College in Ende Hills in Nasarawa State. President Buhari, who was represented at the ceremony by the Minister of Police Affairs, Alhaji Muhammad Maigari Dingyadi, said the construction of the college was part of the unwavering determination of his administration to meet the needs for capacity building and training of tactical squads for the ever expanding operations and deployment needs of the Nigeria Police Force. He said the training college would further address the manpower needs of the newly created PMF Squadrons across the country. Earlier in his remarks, the Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, said the college is a critical national security asset established as part of the strategic approaches of the Nigeria Police Force to strengthen the capacity of the special and tactical operations arms of the force in dealing with present and emerging security threats in the country on a sustainable basis. The IG also noted that the new PMF college would complement the existing PMF training colleges in Gwoza, Borno State and Ila Oragun, Osun State, and would also serve as a training ground for police personnel to be deployed for local and international assignments such as the UN/AU peacekeeping operations as well as support for counter-terrorism training programmes. Adamu thanked the Governor of Nasarawa State, Abdullahi Sule; Lafiya Emirate, the host community, corporate organisations and well-meaning Nigerians whose goodwill and exceptional support ensured the accomplishment of the project.
