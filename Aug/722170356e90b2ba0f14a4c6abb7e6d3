By Chinedu Eze The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) on Thursday said the resumption of international flights had now been shifted to September 5. The Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, had previously announced two weeks ago that international flights would resume operations on August 29, 2020. Director-General of the NCAA, Musa Shuaibu Nuhu, revealed the news during a Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 briefing in Abuja. He said while airlines and airports were ready to operate, other non-aviation logistics prompted the one-week extension. “We have other non-aviation logistics we are still working on, mostly the COVID-19 protocol tests and online platform,” he said, adding, “We need to get this ready.” Nuhu described September 5 as sacrosanct and remarked that the initial announcement was that flights resumption would be anytime from the 29th. “In due course, we will be announcing the protocols for the resumption and we will be giving further details,” he said. “Hopefully early next week, we will release this,” the Director-General said.
