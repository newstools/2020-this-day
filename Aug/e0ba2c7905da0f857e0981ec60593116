Juventus and Argentine forward Paulo Dybala defeated his teammate Cristiano Ronaldo to emerge the Italian Serie A Most Valuable Player (MVP) for the 2019/20 season. Serie A’s governing body announced the awards earlier yesterday with Dybala being voted MVP following his strong campaign for the Bianconeri. Dybala managed 17 goals in all competitions this season and is widely seen as the creative force behind Juve’s success this term. He was also one of only three players who produced double figures for both goals and assists in Italy’s top flight this season. Ronaldo scored 31 league goals for Juventus this season, with only Ciro Immobile netting more after finishing on a record-equalling 36 strikes. As a consequence, Immobile beat Ronaldo to the Striker of the Season award. The former Real Madrid star won the award in his debut season in Italy.
