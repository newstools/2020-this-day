By Igbawase Ukumba The Tiv people of Nasarawa State yesterday told Governor Abdullahi Sule for saving them from immeasurable destruction of their lives and property upon his assumption of office as governor of the state. The Tiv people said this through their spokesman, Prof Emmanuel Kucha, when they paid a solidarity visit to the governor in the Goverment House, Lafia. According to them, “in the past five years before your assumption of office as governor of Nasarawa State, we saw no peace. “We were exposed to immeasurable devastation and destruction of lives and property, and left in the state of total disrepair. However since your assumption of office, you left no stone unturned to restore and sustain peace in Nasarawa State.”
A situation the Tiv people attributed to the relative peace been enjoyed in the state as they (Tiv have massively resumed farming and can now sleep with eyes closed without fear of attack and molestation. “In the same vein, you have not lost sleep in brokering peace with neighbouring states. Indeed, by this posture you have become the shelter of the people of Nasarawa State tagged ‘Zege-Mule U Tiv Nasarawa State’,” they said. In a remark, Governor Sule called on the Tiv people to eschew bitterness and live in peace with their neighbours as acccording to him, “government has spent too much money on maintenance of peace instead of channeling the said money to develop the wellbeing of people of the state.” The governor however expressed dissatisfaction at some reported cases where Tiv traditional domains were been superintended by non-Tiv people in the state. He said: “It will not make sense if a Non-Tiv is a traditional ruler in a Tiv traditional domain. It is even out of place for the Tiv people of the state to plead for traditional stools in the state.”
