Guaranty Trust Bank Plc has slashed the monthly dollar spending limit on its customersâ€™ naira Mastercard to $100, for international transactions. The bank made this known in a text message it sent to customers yesterday. The bank had in February this year, reduced the monthly spending limit to $500, from the $1,500 it was previously, due to the reduced forex inflow in the country. The move which is aimed at conserving the greenback is also in response to the present economic realities.
