By Vanessa Obioha Fuji music icon, King Wasiu Ayinde Marshal, known by the monikers K1 De Ultimate and KWAM 1, has announced that he will be dropping a new musical project in a few weeks. He is working on a new EP that will be released this month. The announcement comes on the heels of his newly released single ‘Awade’. The song is one of the hits listed in the six-track Extended Play (EP), titled ‘Fuji, the Sound’. Praised as a custodian of the African percussion-heavy music, K1 has seen it all in his over five decades career; enjoying critical and commercial success home and abroad in a career span that has taken him from a young upstart in 1970 to an African cultural authority. Throughout his illustrious career, K1 who is also the first Mayegun of Yorubaland, has recorded over 60 musical projects in his discography. As a forward-thinking interpretation of Fuji, the upcoming EP is a product of two years of tweaking and experimentation across languages and the music forms set, ultimately, to the rhythmic drum-heavy pattern of puritan Fuji music. The urban spirit is reflected in the team of collaborators that the music icon assembles including producer, Mystro, and singers, Teni and Toby Grey. ‘Fuji the Sound’ EP will arrive on August 21.
