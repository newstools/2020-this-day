Zlatan Ibrahimovic is on the brink of signing a new one-year contract at AC Milan after his impressive return to form with the Serie A side at the end of last season. According to Sky Italy, the two parties are closing in on an agreement that will fall between the £4.5m-a-year offered by Milan and the £6.7m asked for by Ibrahimovic. Milan are looking to wrap things up and make an announcement before Monday, when their squad returns for pre-season training. Ibrahimovic, 38, rejoined Milan last December after 18 months in the United States with Los Angeles Galaxy. Back at the San Siro, the Swede fired in an impressive 11 goals in 20 appearances and Milan want to keep hold of the striker for the upcoming campaign. Ibrahimovic previously spent two years at the club from 2010, joining from Barcelona. He won the Serie A title there in 2011, followed by the Italian Super Cup the next season. But now, Milan are somewhat of a fallen giant in Italy and Ibrahimovic is tasked with helping restore the side to their former glories. They finished sixth in Serie A last season, with Stefano Pioli’s side qualifying for the Europa League. The new Serie A season will start on September 19, with fixtures for the campaign yet to be announced.
