By Ndubuisi Francis As governments around the world implement strategies to boost local economies amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the Managing Director/Chief Executive of Transcorp Hotels, Dupe Olusola, has prescribed investment in infrastructure development to boost domestic and international tourism in Nigeria. Olusola spoke while representing the tourism and hospitality sector at the virtual Presidential Policy Dialogue which had in attendance Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo. She said: “We have not maximised our tourism potential as much as we should have done and infrastructure plays a vital part in this. Developing infrastructure in the rural areas where natural land formations and fascinating tourist’s sites have found themselves is critical to the growth of the sector. “We require active participation from all stakeholders to achieve this development. The private sector needs to work with the government to develop the tourism monuments of our nation, building better infrastructure such as roads, telecommunications, airports that can link the tourist sites and attract both local and international tourists.” In his remarks, Vice-President Osinbajo stressed that the deepening of engagement between public and private sectors on infrastructure development was essential for the preservation of jobs, and modernisation of Nigeria’s economy.
