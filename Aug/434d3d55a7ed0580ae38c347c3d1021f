Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for the Edo Governorship election, has congratulated striker Victor Osimhen over his record deal with Italian club, Napoli. Victor Osimhen, who hails from Edo State, is the Italian club’s latest addition following the completion of a deal reported to be worth over 70 million Euros, a feat which makes him the club’s record signing and possibly Africa’s most expensive football player. In his congratulatory message, Ize-Iyamu described the move as a deserving success for the “talented and hardworking Victor Osimhen who stopped at nothing to make his dreams come true.” He said: “In Victor Osimhen we find the deep well of strength and single-minded devotion that is symbolic of the Edo character. These and more are the qualities that propelled the young talent into limelight. And if there is better news, it is that from his example, we can draw and get convinced that such excellent qualities are deposited in us all.” Ize-Iyamu urged Osimhen to remain focused and set new records at his new club while also praying to God to grant him a long, fruitful, and injury-free football career.
