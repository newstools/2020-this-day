By James Sowole Almost two weeks after his emergence as the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the October 10, 2020, governorship election, Eyitayo Jegede, has visited his former principal, Dr. Olusegun Mimiko, in his Ondo City home. Many political watchers had been wondering over the seeming frosty relationship between Mimiko and Jegede after the 2016 governorship election, which Jegede lost to the incumbent state Governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu. The PDP candidate had refused to visit the former governor, whom he served as the state Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, even when he was campaigning for the party’s ticket. Though Jegede said his visit was a private one, some saw the visit as an attempt by the candidate to seek the support of his former boss, who is now a chieftain of the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP). Jegede said: “I went to the home of my former boss, Dr. Olusegun Mimiko, on a private visit, not more than a courtesy call, notwithstanding that we belong to different political parties.”
