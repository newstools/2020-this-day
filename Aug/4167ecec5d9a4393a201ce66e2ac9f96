More investments should be made in the education sector, especially as regards infrastructure, teachers, and curriculum that will turn our better-equipped students and graduates.
“The issue of job creation must also occupy the front burner for various tiers of government as a productive generation of youth is critical to the development of a nation at all times,”he stressed. He stressed that the government at various levels should lead the way in making investments on things that will place our youth in a vantage position to compete in a highly competitive society.
