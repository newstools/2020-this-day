Michael emphasised on the pandemic and the wisdom of the state governor in taking entrepreneurship development seriously. “In today’s reality where millions have lost their jobs and several entrepreneurs struggle to sustain their businesses, it is important to note that unemployment poses to be a more devastating threat, and the need to plan against such is of the highest priority,” AYE boss stated.
