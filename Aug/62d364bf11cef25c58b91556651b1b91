Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja Fighter jets of the Air Task Force (ATF) of Operation Lafiya Dole yesterday bombarded settlements hosting leaders of terrorist group, Islamic State for West African Province (ISWAP), in the Lake Chad part of northern Borno State. The ‘massive and simultaneous’ air strikes were executed under the subsidiary of Operation Hail Storm at Kirta Wulgo and Sabon Tumbun, two settlements on the fringes of the Lake Chad area, where several key ISWAP leaders and scores of their fighters were killed. A military update issued by the Directorate of Defence Media Operations (DDMO) said the missions were conducted on the heels of intelligence reports indicating that some ISWAP leaders and fighters had relocated to Sabon Tumbun due to the impact of the recent air strikes at the nearby Island settlement of Tumbuma Baba. It said 15 high-ranking ISWAP commanders and scores of their fighters were harboured at Kirta Wulgo, which serves as the administrative headquarters and training camp for ISWAP. “Accordingly, the Air Task Force dispatched an enhanced force package of the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) fighter jets and helicopter gunships to attack the two locations, scoring devastating hits leading to the elimination of several of the terrorists. “Prominent terrorist leaders, including Abu Imraana, ISWAP naval commander, as well as Mallam Ibrahim and Mallam Abba, are believed to be among the many ISWAP casualties,” the update signed by the Coordinator of DDMO, Major General John Enenche, said.
