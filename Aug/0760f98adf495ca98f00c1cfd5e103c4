Here in Melbourne we have the most troops on our streets since we were last in a war. It appears to be the same in many cities around the world but why? Like most people I respect the military forces and the work they do to protect us but like the police I like to know they are here for me but don’t always want them around me as it suggests trouble in some form. The use of these groups as support does suggest that society is breaking down and not just as a result of the fear of a virus. The majority of public uproar regarding COVID seems to revolve around the apparent loss of freedoms, but we should be more concerned about the loss of lives. Let’s bunker down, at home, respect our laws and hope or pray that science can help us and soon. Dennis Fitzgerald,
