Ramon Abbas, the Nigerian Instagram celebrity with the name “Hushpuppi,’ has been arraigned in an American court in California as his trial begins on October 13. Abbas pleaded not guilty to the four-count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, money laundering conspiracies, international money laundering and engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity. In June, the 37-year-old known for flaunting an opulent lifestyle on social media, was arrested in Dubai by special operatives of the Emerati Police and American Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The FBI’s investigation, according to the affidavit obtained by Premium Times alleged that Abbas financed this extravagant lifestyle through crime. He is alleged to be the leader of a group that facilitates computer intrusion, business email compromise (BEC) fraud and money laundering. His targeted victims, majorly in the US, had been duped of hundreds of millions of dollars, the FBI says. In July, Abbas alongside Olalekan Ponle, popularly known as Woodberry, was extradited to Chicago in the United States where he was first arraigned. However, because the U.S. Court in Illinois does not have jurisdiction over the case, he was transferred to Los Angeles, a city in California. Since his transfer to California late July, he has been held in the custody of the U.S. Marshal in a federal prison. Arraignment Meanwhile, the prosecutor has kickstarted the process of arraignment by filling necessary documents and forms after his first appearance on August 17. After the pre-trial services, Abbas entered a plea, insisting that he is not guilty of the charges.
