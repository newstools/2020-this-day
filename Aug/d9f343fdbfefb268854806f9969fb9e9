The contractor handling the Moniya/Ijaiye/Iseyin road, in Oyo State, Kopek Construction Company Limited, has assured that the project will be completed by January, 2021. The firm stated that it will not compromise quality and standard to get the job done despite the disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The Project Manager of the road, Mr. Paul Chamoun, while addressing journalists during a tour to the site, said though five weeks had been lost due to the lockdown, work on the 65-kilometre road has reached 40 per cent completion. He assured that despite the virus impact and the unfavorable weather due to rains, work was progressing at the project site and would be completed on time without compromising quality, stating that the project which was awarded in January, 2020 and billed for completion within twelve months. Reacting to the effects of COVID-19 on the ongoing road project, Chamoun lamented, “truly, COVID-19 deadly pandemic has disturbed our planning for sure just like everybody in all the world.” According to him, “You know we cannot work every day with the same pace of work that will be achieved on a daily basis as planned because of the rain. And, as everybody knows, we are concern with the quality, we are not going to compromise with the quality. So, if there is rain and there are some jobs or activities that cannot be done because it will affect the quality, we will not do it. “Before COVID-19, my target was to finish as planned, based on that, we have mobilised. With this our plan, we will finish in twelve months. You know that the job is 65km, it is not a small job at all. COVID-19 came, it was unplanned and unexpected, we have lost more than one month and after that, the rainy season, who knows later on what will happen? Now, I have doubled my efforts to compensate the days that were lost.”
