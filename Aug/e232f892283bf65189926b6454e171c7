By Kayode Fasua Ogun State governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, has lauded the appointment of former Ogun State governor, Chief Olusegun Osoba, as chairman of the Governing Council of the Nigerian Institute of Journalism (NIJ). Abiodun said it was a true call to service and one suitable enough to be described fittingly as fixing a round peg in a round hole. Osoba, according to Abiodun, spent his most productive years as a respected member of the fourth estate of the realm, and established a reputation for diligent and responsible journalism. “Even when not in active practice, he still sees himself, first as a reporter before anything else and keeps mentoring younger professionals. “Yes, he has been a decorated administrator, statesman and boardroom guru, but journalism remains his primary constituency and flows in his blood stream”, the governor said. He added, “It is a tribute to the undying reportorial excellence and acknowledgement of his prowess that Chief Osoba was unanimously adopted by a council peopled by the best and brightest across all sections of the media.” Abiodun also thanked the Publisher of Vanguard Newspaper, Sam Amuka and Chairman of THISDAY, Mr Nduka Obaigbena, for their support and solidarity for the new NIJ council chairman, saying, “Baba Osoba will see this a true call to service”. “Coming from these veterans, it is clearly redemption time for NIJ to reposition journalism training and practice. “I have no reservations whatsoever that Chief Osoba will provide that leadership and the successor generation of journalists will be better for it”. Osoba has Mr Ray Ekpu, another outstanding journalist, as his deputy. Osoba is returning to the NIJ Governing Council chair he occupied 30 years ago. He is a first class reporter who had many scoops and exclusive investigative reports to his credit. He is also a well-known media manager before his foray into politics.
