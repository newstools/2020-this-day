*COVID-19 evacuation flights end Aug. 25 Chinedu Eze in Lagos, Olawale Ajimotokan and Kasim Sumaina in Abuja Nigeria will resime international flights on August 29, Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, has announced. International flight operations were suspended by the Federal Government in March as part of the measures to curb the spread of COVID-19. Announcing the resumption on Monday in a tweet from his twitter handle @hadisirika, the minister said international flight operations would begin at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport Abuja and the Murtala Muhammed International Airport Lagos. Sirika said protocols and procedures for flight resumption would be announced in due course. “Glad to announce the resumption of international flights from the 29th of August, 2020. Beginning with Lagos and Abuja as we did with the domestic flight resumption. Protocols and procedures will be announced in due course. We thank you for your patience”, he tweeted. Sirika in a statement in Abuja by Director, Public Affairs, Ministry of Aviation, James Odaudu, further disclosed that as a result of this, all evacuation flights which were introduced in the wake of the ban on international flights occasioned by the outbreak of the coronavirus, will end on August 25. For five months, the federal government had shut down airports for international flights in order to curb the spread of COVID-19 pandemic, which was ravaging the world. Some countries have since reopened their airports, while others are on the verge of doing so. But few countries, which had very low record of Coronavirus cases, like Equatorial Guinea and Benin Republic, opened their airports many weeks ago and became the window through which Nigerians and others in West and Central Africa travelled to international destinations.
