By Laleye Dipo Former military president, Gen. Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida (rtd), on Monday celebrated his 79th birthday in low-key affair. Only members of his immediate family and very close associates joined the former military president in the celebration. His children led by Mohammed and others joined the former head of state in cutting his 79th birthday cake. Among close associates at his uphill residence for the celebration were a former NACCIMA National President, Alhaji Sani Ndanusa, Justice Musa Dattijo, and a former member of the House of Representatives, Alhaji Abdullahi Musa, and Alhaji Hassan Jallo. The Chief Imam of the IBB mosque, Alhaji Ibrahim Turuluku, led the prayers for long life and good health of the celebrant. Some well wishers, who brought greeting cards and other gifts, were asked to drop them at the gate in compliance with the social distancing protocol which forbids large gathering at such events. According to one of Babangida’s media aides, Alhaji Mahmood Abdullahi, the former head of state was dressed in brown babanriga with a cap to match. “He was hale and hearty and full of smiles,” Abdullahi said.
