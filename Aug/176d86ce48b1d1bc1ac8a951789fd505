By Seriki Adinoyi The Northern Governors Forum has eulogised the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Muhammad Sa’ad Abubakar III, on his 64th birthday, recognising his immense support in the areas of security, poverty alleviation and Almajiri phenomenon. In a statement by the Chairman of the Forum and Governor of Plateau State, Simon Lalong, the governors said: “You have remained a great advocate of good governance, peaceful coexistence and accountable leadership which explains your consistent support and wise counsel particularly to governors of the northern region and the country at large. We are proud of your advocacy and support towards tackling the challenges of the region as you remain a source of inspiration to the Northern Governors Forum.” They added that the Forum “has drawn a lot of support from the royal father in areas addressing insecurity, poverty, illiteracy as well as ending the Almajiri phenomenon, which had defied various attempts to end it, until recently when governors of the region took bold steps to return Almajiris to their families and also take care of their education and welfare”. While praying God to grant the royal father good health, more wisdom and divine protection, the Forum urged him not to relent in availing the nation of his wealth of experience and fatherly advice on critical issues that border on the well being of the people.
