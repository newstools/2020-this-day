UEFA CHAMPIONS LEAGUE Lyon star Maxwel Cornet couldn’t hide his delight after helping his side shock Manchester Cityin the Champions League quarter-finals on Saturday night. The Ivorian scored the opening goal in the Ligue 1club’s 3-1 win over Pep Guardiola’s City side in Lisbon to book a spot in the last-four. Cornet also scored the opener in Lyon’s group stage win over the Premier Leagueside in September 2018 and was pleased to play another key role in a brave display against City. The 23-year-old told RMC Sport: ‘These are exceptional matches to play in, they don’t come along everyday, I have succeeded once more against Man City. ‘We have to underline the work of the team. I am delighted. ‘We are lucky to play against the best players in the world. We are not here by accident, we have worked very hard, we have never given up.’ Lyon were arguably deserving of their win against the Premier League outfit, as they defended well and always looked a threat on the counter-attack. But several pundits gave the French side little hope of winning before the game, though Cornet said his side dealt with the pre-match negativity. He added: ‘That is part of football, the most important thing is to rout the doubters, that is what I have done, I have always given my all for the shirt. ‘I do not know if we were underestimated, we do our work in complete humility. We work each day. We have to continue like this.’ Next up for Lyon is a daunting semi-final against Bayern Munich on Wednesday, who thumped Lionel Messi’s Barcelona 8-2 in Lisbon just 24 hours before Lyon beat City. Cornet believes his side are capable of beating the Bundesliga side as they have proved they possess the desire to get over difficult challenges, such as City. The Ivorian said: ‘We know the attacking power of this team, we saw it again vs Barca. ‘It will be a difficult match that we will have to play with desire, there is no reason why we shouldn’t succeed.’
