Adibe Emenyonu in Benin City The Candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Edo State, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, has flayed Governor Godwin Obaseki, for allegedly playing politics with Edo people’s health. In an interview, Monday, the APC flagbearer decried how the governor locked up the new Specialist Hospital, Benin allegedly because of bitter politics. He remarked that “Some of our people travel all the way to Benin city for healthcare but have to pay through their nose because the governor, after politicising the Benin Specialist Hospital and kept it under lock and key for no other reason except bitter and petty politics, handed it to some private individuals, who are charging the people steep prices, in a hospital built with public funds.” Pastor Ize-Iyamu said the Benin hospital would not have been a double jeopardy, had Obaseki delivered on his promise of building primary health centres in all of Edo’s 192 wards. According to him, “This government promised to build a primary health centre in all 192 wards. In four years, he built none. So, Edo communities have to travel several kilometres just to see a doctor.” He said such hardship, from an “insensitive leader”, would exit with Obaseki, when he is voted out on September 19″, pledging that his administration will change all of that by harnessing the resource potentials of the state across all the three senatorial districts. The APC candidate charged the Edo people to regard voting out Obaseki as a serious moral duty, that must be done on September 19. He also appealed for a “clear and sweeping” mandate, so that the hard task of rebuilding Edo could start without delay.
