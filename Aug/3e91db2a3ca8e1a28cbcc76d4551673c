Italian Serie A side, Inter Milan ruthlessly dispatched Shakhtar Donetsk 5-0 last night to set up Europa final clash with Sevilla on Friday. Former Super Eagles winger, Victor Moses, played the last nine minutes of the second semi final as Romelu Lukaku and Lautaro Martinez each scored a brace to dismiss the Ukrainian giants. Friday’s match will mark Sevilla’s return to the final since completing three straight wins in 2016 to add to their two previous titles, while Inter have not featured in the showpiece fixture since 1998 when they won third crown in this competition.
