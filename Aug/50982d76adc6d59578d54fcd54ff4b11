Inter Milan have completed the permanent signing of Manchester United forward Alexis Sanchez on a three-year deal. The Chile international, 31, joined the Serie A side on a season-long loan in August 2019. He scored four goals in 29 appearances in all competitions. Inter expect to have him available for the Europa League ‘final eight’ in Germany after beating Getafe on Wednesday. “We have agreed [the deal],” United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer told BT Sport on Wednesday after his side also reached the quarter-finals with a win over LASK. “He has enjoyed his time there. He is a top player but for whatever reason we didn’t see the best of him. He is a top professional and we wish him all the best.” The precise terms of the deal are unknown but is almost certain to have involved United taking a significant financial hit. Sanchez played 45 games for United after joining from Arsenal in 2018,scoring just five goals. He becomes the third player to join Inter from United in the past 12 months, with striker Romelu Lukakuand midfielder Ashley Younghaving made similar switches.
