Paris Saint-Germain are reportedly considering a move for Nigerian forward Odion Ighalo. The 31-year-old joined Manchester United on loan from Shanghai Shenhua in January and has been in good form for the Red Devils, scoring five times in 18 appearances in all competitions. The striker is due to remain with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side until January 2021, when he is expected to return to his parent club. However, according to Fussballtransfers, PSG are lining up a move for the attacker as they look to bring in a replacement for their all-time leading goalscorer Edinson Cavani. Ighalo only has little over a year left to run on his current deal with Shanghai, although the Chinese outfit are said to be hopeful of agreeing fresh terms. The Nigerian has scored twice in four Europa League appearances this term but is still waiting for his first Premier League goal for Solskjaer’s side. Manchester United signed Ighalo on loan in January, with many criticising the Red Devils for that decision. However, the Nigeria international has done little wrong for the club since moving and has scored five goals in the time since his arrival. United extended Ighalo’s loan spell in June to run until January 2021, with the former Watford star acting as cover to Anthony Martial and Mason Greenwood up. PSG have been linked, however, with Thomas Tuchel impressed by Ighalo and wanting him to deputise for the likes of Kylian Mbappe and Mauro Icardi next season. There are claims in some quarters however that PSG have yet to touch base with Ighalo’s camp about a potential move to the Parc des Princes. However, the Nigeria international is said to have no interest in swapping Old Trafford for the Parc des Princes. The striker in currently in Cologne with Manchester United squad and is preparing for their Europa League semifinal clash against Seville tomorrow.
Ighalo will be hoping for a chance to make an impact in the game as United look to move a step closer to the trophy. UEFA CHAMPIONS LEAGUE
