A National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) member serving in Nasarawa State, Mr. Taiwo Durodola, has invented a body temperature-reading device. In a statement issued yesterday, NYSC’s Director of Press and Public Relations, Adenike Adeyemi, said the device named T-Smart does not require human intervention while in operation. She added that it can also be monitored remotely. “In response to the challenge thrown to their creative ingenuity by the NYSC Director- General, Brigadier General Shuaibu Ibrahim, arising from COVID-19 pandemic, Corps Members have taken up the gauntlet, and continued to amaze Nigerians with so many inventions, tailored towards stemming the spread of the virus in the country,” Adeyemi said. “In the past few months, some Corps Members across the length and breath of the country have come up with a number of inventions in response to the challenge thrown by the NYSC helmsman — thus, underscoring the centrality of the Scheme as catalyst for unity and national development. “Devices such as disinfection chambers, pedal- operated water, soap and sanitiser dispensers have been invented and donated to the Federal and State Governments, as well as some communities, as part of efforts by the National Youth Service Corps to battle COVID-19, which regrettably remains a formidable enemy that must be defeated. “However, it is heartwarming to note that Corps Member Taiwo Durodola serving in Nasarawa State has taken the fight against the virus a notch higher through the invention of T-Smart, a body-temperature reading device which undoubtedly will give a big boost to the current efforts to contain the virus in the country. “It is highly sensitive and accurate, with a resolution of 0.02 degree Celsius, which makes it possible to detect the smallest change in human body temperature. was invented to curb the spread of coronavirus.” Adeyemi said invention of the corps members have the capacity of earning foreign exchange for the country, if patented and mass-produced.
