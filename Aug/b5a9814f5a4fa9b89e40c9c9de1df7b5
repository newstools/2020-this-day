For the second time, TrickyTee survives the eviction axe in the Big Brother Naija show. He was among the four housemates with least number of votes. However, it was the end of the journey for Kaisha, who was nominated alongside Wathoni and Neo. She was the only housemate evicted this week. Kaisha’s eviction was imminent. The past week in the house saw her engage in an altercation with Nengi that fans feared the spar may fetch them a strike or a disqualification. Nengi accused Kaisha of hissing at her after inquiring from her what happened with the electric kettle. They threw insults at each other without restraints, although Kaisha cautiously avoided any physical contact, while Nengi in her fit of anger mildly pushed her out of the way. Before the live eviction show began, most of the housemates revealed that they would vote out Kaisha if asked to send someone home during their diary session with Biggie. During her chat with Ebuka, the host, Kaisha said she was not surprised that she was voted out. She disclosed she was aware that her fellow housemates didn’t like her, and was surprised that they saved her last week. Regarding her relationship with Neo, she said that she liked him initially but didn’t pursue it because someone was in the picture. Only 15 housemates are left in the game. Will TrickyTee survive another week if he emerges at the bottom four next week?
