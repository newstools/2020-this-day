Given the impact of the pandemic on businesses nationwide, Wema Bank said it recently organised a free capacity building session for female entrepreneurs. The first of these training sessions focused on helping professional and businesswomen “Restructure their business, career and finances for the future”. It disclosed that ‘Sara by Wema’ had organised a virtual webinar tagged “Juggling Home Schooling & Work,” that was designed to cater to the women with children who were working from home amidst the pandemic. In partnership with Wise Planner Consulting, Sara By Wema selected women through a competition on its Instagram page and other online platform for the recent webinar themed “Business Growth”. “The Business Growth webinar is a 2- class training that offered participants in-depth knowledge on how to structure their business and manage cashflow. “To help women with online stores generate more sales on Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, Sara by Wema partnered with Divigate360 for the “Boost With Facebook” webinar. “The 3-day training session had over 200 participants and held via Zoom. Divided into two daily sessions, the webinar enlightened female entrepreneurs on how the digital space can affect their business positively and how to use Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram to grow their business,” a statement from the bank explained. Executive Director (ED)- Business Support, Wema Bank, Mrs Folake Sanu said, “In times like this, growing your business may seem difficult, however consistency, restructuring and re-strategising your business are ways to thrive as an entrepreneur.”
