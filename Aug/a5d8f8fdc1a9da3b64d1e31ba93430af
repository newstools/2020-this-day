By Seriki Adinoyi Plateau State Governor and Chairman of the Northern Governors Forum, Simon Lalong, has rejoiced with Nigerian Muslims on the occasion of another Eid-el-Kabir, urging them not to allow the impact of the Coronavirus pandemic to demoralise their faith. The governor, who felicitated with the Muslims in a statement, said this year’s celebration comes at a peculiar time when the world is working hard to tame the Coronavirus pandemic which has altered the way of life of people across the globe. He said, “Although the Muslim faithful is marking this year’s Salah in unusual circumstances of restrictions, the essence of this spiritual event cannot be neglected. This is the time to demonstrate the virtues of peace, love, sacrifice and tolerance that are taught by the Prophet Mohammed.” Lalong urged the Muslim ummah to exercise patience with restrictions that have been imposed to curtail COVID-19 as the guidelines issued are meant to prevent the spread of the disease and protect lives. He also reassured the people of Plateau State that his administration is taking proactive measures to ensure that the economy is boosted despite the setbacks occasioned by the pandemic. He urged the entire people of the state to “continue to live in peace with one another, and consolidate on the tranquility currently pervading the state,” calling on them to report all suspicious activities to security agencies who have made elaborate plans to tackle crime and criminality during the festive period. Recall that the governor had banned all gatherings at any prayer ground across the state, placed restriction on gathering recreation centres across the state, and banned operations of tricycles during the festive period. All these were deliberate efforts by his government to tackle the spread of Coronavirus.
