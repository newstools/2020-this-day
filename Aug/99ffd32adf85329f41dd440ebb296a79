Akwa Ibom State Government has given a nod to the state Covid-19 Incident Management Committee to continue in its aggressive community testing for coronavirus cases and immediate isolation and treatment of persons who have tested positive for the virus. The state Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Comrade Ini Ememobong, made this known while fielding questions on News Day on ARISE TV in Uyo. The commissioner stated that the state Governor, Mr. Udom Emmanuel, had directed that aggressive community testing for Covid-19 be carried out in the state as part of his administrationâ€™s efforts to curb further spread of the virus. He stated that apart from the regular testing of those showing symptoms and those identified by contact tracing, it was necessary for the state government to intensify efforts in carrying out aggressive community testing in order to win the fight against the health pandemic. The state Spokesman said that the approach was one of the adopted measures by the state government to further ensure that students in exit classes currently writing their mandatory examinations as well as those writing the ongoing Senior Schools Certificate Examinations, SSCE were given full protection from contracting the virus. The commissioner further added that prior to the commencement of the examination, the state government had procured a large number of facemasks for distribution to secondary schools in the state which he said had long been given out to the students for their personal use. He hinted that although a lot of students had been tested, only one sample was confirmed positive. He explained that the affected student was currently writing the examination from one of the isolation centres in the state with additional measures put in place to ensure that the integrity of the examination was not compromised.
