The first NASA water landing since 1975 in the SpaceX capsule has been reported in many newspapers. It brings back memories of the Government Apollo program, moon landings and John F Kennedy, the President who inspired it all. Move forward to the present and you have a privately supported space program, moon landing conspiracies and a president that does not inspire and does not really listen to scientists. Who should we send on a one-way trip to Mars? I can suggest one obvious candidate. Dennis Fitzgerald,
