Paul Pogba’s agent Mino Raiola has confirmed the midfielder will be staying at Manchester United this summer. The World Cup winner’s future has been up in the air for the last 12 months and he looked certain to leave Old Trafford earlier in the season. Talk of moves to Real Madrid and Juventus intensified before the coronavirus pandemic, with the £89million man having less than a year left on his current deal. But speaking to Sky Sport Italia, the 27-year-old’s agent confirmed he will not be leaving Old Trafford this summer, with the midfielder also set for a new deal to take him past 2021 after talks were confirmed. ‘Paul Pogba will stay at Manchester United,’ Raiola told the Italian outlet. ‘Pogba is key player for Man Utd, they’ve an important project and he’s 100% included. Man Utd will not accept any bid this summer to sell Pogba. ‘We’re going to speak about a new contract soon, no stress.’ Reports had emerged ever since United qualified for next season’s Champions League through the Premier League top four route that Pogba was ready to sign a new deal. However, other reports in Italy claimed new Juventus boss Andrea Pirlo was keen on bringing his former team-mate back to the Serie A champions. Further reports in Italy had also suggested Juventus could offer former Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey or Argentine star Paulo Dybala in exchange, but that door appears to be firmly shut. Overall, it was a frustrating season for the former Juventus midfielder, playing just seven games in the first half of the season before undergoing surgery on a persistent ankle injury in January. But the coronavirus hiatus allowed the 27-year-old to recover from injury and play a fundamental role in United qualifying for Europe’s top club competition. He also began to develop a promising midfield partnership with talismanic January signing Bruno Fernandes, while it appears his relationship with United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is on the mend.
