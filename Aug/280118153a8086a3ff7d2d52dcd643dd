For a fact, one of the things often said about Bola Tinubu, the darling wife of Jubril Adewale Tinubu, a super-rich and successful oil tycoon, is that she is still her “usual self”, in spite of her privileged position. She is rarely seen at most high-profile society parties, just as she also shies away from publicity as much as possible. A successful corporate lawyer, she is known more as a child advocate, as she has developed a strong passion in helping sexually abused children. In pursuit of this noble quest, the mother of five established the first free children’s helpline in Nigeria – Cece Yara Foundation. The foundation, which helps in the prevention of child sexual abuse in Nigeria, opened the Cece Yara Child Advocacy Centre, a state-of-the-art Forensic Suite for children who have experienced sexual abuse, in Lagos. Perhaps, the foregoing explains why she was appointed by the Lagos State governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu as the Chairman, Governing Council for the Office of the Public Defender, OPD, last Tuesday. The OPD was established 20 years ago by Bola Ahmed Tinubu to provide legal aid and to safeguard the fundamental human rights of vulnerable persons, disadvantaged groups and indigent residents of Lagos State. Her appointment has been applauded by many who believe it was well deserved, especially given her commitment to the cause of the abused female members of the society. Many will recall that her fight for humanity earned her recognition in the BBC’s 100 Women of 2018 – the list which celebrated 100 inspiring and influential women ranging from age 15 to 94 from around the world, including leaders, trailblazers and everyday heroes from over 60 countries.
