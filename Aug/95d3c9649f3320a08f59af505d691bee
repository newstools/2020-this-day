By Adedayo Akinwale The United States government has expressed concern over the deteriorating political climate in Edo State. It also expressed disappointment with the role played by some political actors in the state and the alleged interference by security forces in political matters. The US Mission in Abuja in a statement issued Friday said as the 2020 off-cycle elections in Edo and Ondo draw nearer, all stakeholders should work towards a free, fair, transparent, and peaceful process. The US also urged all stakeholders, including the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), political parties, and the security services, to continue to improve the electoral process. It stated: “As long-time friends of Nigeria, we continue to follow political developments ahead of off-cycle elections in the country. The United States supports a democratic process where the will of the Nigerian people is reflected in the results, and does not favor any party or candidate. “We are concerned with reports of the deteriorating political climate in Edo State and are disappointed with the role played by some political actors in the state. We are especially concerned with allegations of interference by security forces in political matters, which we will continue to monitor closely in the run up to gubernatorial elections in the state in September. “We look to Nigeria as an important leader on the African continent. As a democratic partner of Nigeria, the United States remains committed to working together to achieve our mutual goals of peace and prosperity for the citizens of both our countries.”
