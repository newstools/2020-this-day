Chinedu Eze The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) has called on travelers to report any official of the agency that would request for money under any guise because the agency does not offer cash services to passengers. The call was made yesterday by the FAAN’s General Manager of Corporate Affairs, Mrs. Henrietta Yakubu. Yakubu said that travelers should be wary of any one requesting cash payment as the nation’s airports reopen gradually for flight operations. She told passengers and other airport users that no aspect of FAAN services at the airports is paid for by cash. “Arriving passengers are expected to have gone through the COVID-19 test before boarding their flights from ports of departure, therefore, they should not pay any money whatsoever to any airport official for that purpose. “All COVID-19 measures put in place at the airports are free for passengers and does not attract any charges,” the statement said. The FAAN spokesperson noted that the authority was aware of the allegation that some airport officials in Abuja were collecting money from returning passengers on evacuation flights. She stated that the claim was already being investigated by all agencies at the airport and appealed to passengers to always ensure adherence to all safety and security measures at the airports. According to Yakubu, FAAN remains committed to its core values of safety, security and comfort of air passengers at the airports. The Nigeria’s government has evacuated thousands of Nigerians since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic that left many Nigerians trapped in various parts of the world. The evacuees were brought back from the United States, United Kingdom, United Arab Emirates, France, Egypt, and Lebanon, among other countries. The latest of the evacuation was the return of 68 Nigerian girls and others at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in Abuja yesterday’s afternoon.
