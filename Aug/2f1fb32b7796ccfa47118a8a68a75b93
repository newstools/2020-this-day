Based on its Direct sales Direct Purchase (DSDP) arrangement, in terms of petroleum product supply, the national oil company stressed that in May 2020, 495.10 million litres of petrol were supplied into the country through the DSDP arrangement as against the 1,812.81 million litres of PMS supplied in April.

Federation crude oil and gas lifting are broadly classified into equity export and domestic, with both categories lifted and marketed by NNPC and the proceeds remitted into the federation account. Equity export receipts, after adjusting for Joint Venture (JV) Cash Calls, are paid directly into Federation Account domiciled in the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), while payments are effected to the account by the NNPC after adjusting crude and product losses and pipeline repairs as well as management cost incurred during the period. According to the corporation, the average crude oil price in May increased by $10 or 61.3 per cent month-on-month $28.93 per barrel, which was the highest in three months as demand started a fragile recovery from the crisis brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.
