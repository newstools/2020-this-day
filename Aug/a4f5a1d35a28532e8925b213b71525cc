Martins Ifijeh A 400-level English student of the National Open University of Nigeria (NOUN), Maryam Adaeze Musa has called on kind hearted Nigerians to help her raise N12 million for an urgent lifesaving kidney transplant. Maryam, a 23- year-old aspiring OAP, who has been suffering from kidney failure since 2019 said the transplant was the definitive treatment for the kidney failure. She is currently on dialysis every three days at the cost of N45,000 per session including the cost of drugs. Being the first child of her parents and the breadwinner of her family when she was still healthy, she was combining work with schooling to help her widowed mother, and younger siblings. She lost her father when she was only 13. According to doctors at the Avon Hospital where Maryam accesses dialysis, the treatment is a temporary one while the definitive therapy for the kidney failure is the transplant for which she is seeking financial assistance to fund the medical procedure. The health challenges of Maryam began when she was 10 years old, having been diagnosed with type two diabetes or juvenile diabetes. She has been managing it until 2019 when the functions of her kidney failed. For support, reach Maryam on 08131959930, 08122777058.
