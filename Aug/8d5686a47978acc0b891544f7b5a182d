Announcing his retirement on Twitter, Casillas said: “The important thing is the path you travel and the people who accompany you, not the destination to which it takes you. “I think I can say, without hesitation, that it has been the path and the dream destination.” Real Madrid said Casillas, who joined the Spanish giants at the age of nine, was the best goalkeeper in the 118-year history of the club. “Real Madrid wants to show its appreciation, admiration and love for one of the greatest legends of our club and world football,” read a statement on the club’s website. “Iker Casillas belongs to the heart of Real Madrid and will be so forever.” In February, he announced his intention to run for the presidency of the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF), before later withdrawingbecause of the “exceptional social, economic and health situation” the country was suffering during the Covid-19 pandemic.
