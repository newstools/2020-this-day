African Voices Changemakers, magazine programme of the Cable News Network (CNN), features two young, passionate Africans devoted to the educational empowerment of youths in their native countries. The programme is sponsored by telecommunications firm, Globacom. They include Orondaam Otto, a Nigerian social reformer and development enthusiast who is an executive director of Slum2School Africa, where he leads a team of 40 managers and hundreds of volunteers to provide equal opportunities for disadvantaged children across slums and remote communities in the country. The 32-year-old got a degree in Human Anatomy from the University of Port Harcourt from where he developed his flair for helping others. His goals include seeing that every African Child gets the best education and to see an Africa whose potentials are maximised, whose story of greatness is told and a continent celebrated for the innovations and uniqueness of her people. The second feature is Peter Tabichi, a science teacher from rural Kenya, who gives away most of his salary to support indigent pupils in his local Nyamira County. Tabichi, 38, a Franciscan friar who teaches Mathematics and Physics at Keriko Mixed Day Secondary School in Pwani, Nakuru County, won the 2019 Global Teacher Prize for his “exceptional” commitment to the pupils of a school in Kenya’s remote Rift Valley region. Both will be on African Voices Changemakers on DSTV Channel 401 on Saturday at 9.00 p.m. and on Sunday at 4.30 a.m., 7.30 a.m., 12.30 p.m. and 7.30 p.m. The programme will be repeated on Monday at 5.30 a.m. on the same channel.
