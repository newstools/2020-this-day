Edo State Governor and candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the September 19 gubernatorial election, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has flagged-off harvesting in Usugbenu farm settlement in Irrua, Esan Central Local Government Area. The governor who continued his ward-to-ward campaign in Edo Central Senatorial District, on Tuesday, ahead of the September 19, 2020 governorship election in the state, assured that the tons of grains from the 475 acres will not only put food on the table of Nigerians, but the excess will be exported. He said the feat was achieved through the government’s efforts aimed at encouraging young Nigerians in the state to venture into mechanised farming and agripreneur. Obaseki assured that farmers in different parts of the state, including Usugbenu, Ugboha, Sobe, Warrake and Agbede, are expected to embark on rotational farming after the harvesting is completed. According to him, “Haven’t you seen for yourself what we are doing? They said that we haven’t done anything, but see what we have here today. “We have several farms and agricultural investments across the state where we are encouraging people to go into mechanised farming. As you can see, this farm is ready for harvesting,” he said. One of the operators of the harvesters, simply identified as Mr. Danjuma, described the government’s investment as phenomenal, noting that the government provided machines for ploughing as well as high quality seedlings and fertiliser.
