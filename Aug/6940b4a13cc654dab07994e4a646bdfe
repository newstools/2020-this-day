The Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) has expressed reservations against certain provisions in the Company and Allied Matters Acts (CAMA) 2020 recently assented to by President Muhammadu Buhari. Specifically, the body faulted Section 839(1) (a), (b), (C) in the Acts, arguing they run contrary to Section 6(6) and Section 36 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. In a statement by National President of PFN, Dr. Felix Omobude, the body said: “We believe that these provisions, among others, leave the door open to abuse, denial of fair hearing, arbitrariness and dubious use of power by the commission and/or its agents.” It expressed serious concerns over the recourse to “the vague and nebulous phrase “public interest” as grounds for taking over a non-governmental organisation by the commission and/or its agents, contrary to Section 36 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. “Not only are there contradictions in the law, we believe that some of its provisions are indeed already covered by other legislations.” The PFN called on President Muhammadu Buhari and the National Assembly to repeal the “offensive parts in the legislation. “The Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) stands with the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) and reaffirms her position on this matter. “We are reviewing all options on the table and we will be taking actions in pursuit of a remedy accordingly. “We intend to assert our constitutional rights, following the prescribed procedure for redress, to ensure that the not-for-profit sector which has been standing in the gap for the disadvantaged and underprivileged Nigerians, in the face of neglect by government at all levels, is able to continues to do so without hindrance.”
