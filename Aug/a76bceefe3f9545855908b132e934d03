As part of its drive to promote awareness against the ravaging effects of COVID-19, create a unity of purpose and help mobilise huge resources for the entire people of Okun land, especially in the area of health development, the Pan-Okun People Relief Response Agenda has commenced moves aimed at actualising its purposes. This was contained in a statement issued by the body after a strategic meeting of its Steering Committee on Monday. It said implementation of the core mandate of the group is being proposed to kick-start this month of August. The committee resolved that healthcare projects across the entire Okun land of Kogi State which will be encompassing and beneficial to the people in a COVID-19 and post COVID-19 era would top all considerations. The group also stated that such intervention as provision of materials in hospitals and healthcare centres across Okun land, which is the main goal of the initiative, could be the groupâ€™s legacy to Okun development at this critical time. The committee further urged members of the group to go all out to canvass for more financial support from public-spirited individuals and groups. It further urged members of the initiative to reach out to prospective donors within the next two weeks in order to speed up implementation process. The group has, as its targets, the sum of N500 Million Naira to enable it support health facilities across Okun land among others.
