An Ogun State High Court yesterday sentenced a 36-year-old man, Mr. Ugochukwu Obiakor, to 25 years’ imprisonment for raping an 11-year- old girl. Obiakor had pleaded not guilty to the single charge. He was convicted for forcefully having sexual intercourse with the 11-year-old. The Chief Judge of Ogun, Justice Mosunmola Dipeolu, held that all evidences presented before the court by the prosecution were tenable and found the convict guilty as charged. Dipeolu consequently sentenced Obiakor to 25 years imprisonment with hard labour. The prosecution counsel and Director of legal drafting in the state, Mr. James Mafe, had earlier told the court during trial that the convict committed the offence on September 4, 2017 at Omu-Aleku village in the Mowe area of Ogun State. He added that the medical results conducted revealed that the victim’s hymen and vagina laceration was broken. He said the victim was in her mother’s shop when the convict came to make purchases. The prosecutor said the convict later came back when the mother left the shop.He said Obiakor told the girl that her mother owed him money, adding that he wanted to collect the sum. The prosecutor said the convict opened the shop’s burglary-proof railings and dragged the victim to an uncompleted building beside the shop where he raped her.
