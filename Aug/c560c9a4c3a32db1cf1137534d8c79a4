By Deji Elumoye A former Speaker of the Parliament of the Economic Community of West African States, ECOWAS Parliament, Senator Ike Ekweremadu, has described the re-elected President of the African Development Bank, Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, as an unapologetic African. In a congratulatory message to Adesina on his re-election on Thursday, the ranking Senator said: “You have proven yourself a true son of Africa, unapologetically and unrepentantly committed to the socio-economic emancipation of the continent and it is my hope that you will lead the Bank to surpass the successes of your first tenure.” He described Adesina’s re-election as “a landmark victory, not only for Nigeria, but also for Africa as a whole”. According to him, “After rain comes sunshine and I congratulate you on your reelection, which is both vindication for your character and competence and a well-deserved reward for all the successes and spectacular progress the African Development Bank has made under your leadership. “I must also commend President Muhammadu Buhari and the people of Nigeria for the leadership and solidarity shown in your matter. “Importantly, there is one big lesson from the entire episode: When we speak with one voice, the world listens.” Ekweremadu, who is the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment, wished Adesina well and prayed God to grant him the grace to continue on the part of excellence.
