Qatar Airways is set to resume four weekly flights to Lisbon, Portugal, from August 14, 2020. The flights would be operated by the airline’s modern, fuel-efficient Boeing 787 Dreamliner offering 22 seats in Business Class and 232 seats in Economy Class. Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive, Mr. Akbar Al Baker, said, “We are pleased to resume flights to Lisbon, further expanding our European network. Lisbon is renowned for its extensive history and culture, boasting a rich artistic and gastronomic heritage and we look forward to support the recovery of its tourism and trade industries. “Passengers from Portugal can also look forward to connecting seamlessly and safely via the Best Airport in the Middle East to more than 30 destinations across Africa, Asia-Pacific, the Middle East and South Asia.” The airline said resumption of Lisbon services would see its operations expand to 225 weekly flights to 33 gateways in Europe. The airline’s mix of modern fuel-efficient aircraft meant its network has never fallen below 30 destinations throughout the pandemic and has enabled it to adapt its plans and quickly resume routes to rebuild its global network. By optimising its mix of aircraft and grounding its A380 fleet, the airline continues to fly only the right sized aircraft on all routes to Europe, reducing its environmental impact by offering sensible and responsible capacity to meet both passenger and cargo demand.
