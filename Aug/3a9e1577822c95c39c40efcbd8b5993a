By James Sowole The All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party in Ondo State yesterday engaged in a verbal war over an overhead bridge project inaugurated by the administration of Governor Rotimi Akeredolu. The governorship candidate of the PDP, Mr. Eyitayo Jegede, while meeting with artisans in the state, allegedly described the project on the Benin- Ore Expressway, as “a phony project.’’ But in a swift reaction, the APC, in a statement issued by its Director of Media and Publicity, Mr. Steve Otaloro, accused Jegede of mischief. “We viewed with disgust the conservative partisan claim of Mr Jegede, in which he insinuated that Governor Akeredolu embarked on a phony project in respect of the overhead bridge built at Ore. “The Ore interchange bridge is one of the ways the government strives to reduce traffic lockdown and the rate of vehicular accidents which, very often, claim the lives of our people around the area.” In his response, Jegede, through the Head of Media and Research of Eyitayo Jegede Campaign Organisation, Mr. Samuel Fasua, insisted that the bridge was a waste of resources. “Desirable as a bridge in Ore was, they shouldn’t gloss over the fact that spending about N6bn on it cannot be justified; this could have catered to three other such projects in the southern senatorial district,” Fasua said.
