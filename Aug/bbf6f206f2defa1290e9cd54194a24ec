Ugo Aliogo Aina Emmanuel also known as Jobaa has just signed a record deal with renowned U.K based record label, JustJoJo Entertainment. The 20-year-old contemporary Afro-pop recording and performing artiste hails from Ekiti State. The Lagos cum London based artiste developed a keen interest in music at an early age. He started making music in his early secondary school days, where he was known as ‘Rico’ before he evolved to ‘Rico P’ and finally the pop talent ‘Jobaa’ which was originated from his first name and the first letter of his last name. Shortly after bagging a Bachelor’s Degree in Public Administration from Babcock University with a second-class upper division, he released his official debut single titled “Sweet Love” featuring Buju which became a sleeper hit. Few months after this move, he was linked with a lucrative deal with U.K based entertainment juggernaut and record label JustJoJo Entertainment led by music marketing genius, Rebecca Junaid. His official debut single is a high-octane cut titled ‘OLLA’, produced by Jaypizzle and engineered by Selebobo (a.k.a Mix Monsta). The single is set to give his counterparts a run for their money, Jobaa is already working on his debut EP project scheduled for release in the first quarter of 2021.
