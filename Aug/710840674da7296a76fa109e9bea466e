Kwara State Governor, Alhaji AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq at the weekend congratulated Dr. Akinwunmi Adesina on his re-election as president of the AfDB. He said the reelection was a triumph of brilliance, vision, and forthrightness. A statement issued in Ilorin that was signed by the Governor’s Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Rafiu Ajakaye, stated: “The Governor commended Adesina for standing firm and focused during his recent trials at the Bank. His eventual clearance affirmed his commitment to transparency and wide acceptance of his rich vision by various power blocs within the Bank.” The statement added: “I join our compatriots to congratulate Dr. Adesina for his uncommon victory and re-election as AfDB President. It is an honour well deserved. “That he was elected by 100 per cent of the votes was a total vote of confidence in his leadership which has no doubt been phenomenal in the history of the bank especially as regards its impacts in the lives of millions of Africans,” the Governor said. He added: “While his first term tenure indeed brought so much growth to African economies, we believe that Dr Adesina will beat his own sterling record in this second term as he takes the AfDB to a greater height.”
