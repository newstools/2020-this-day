Duro Ikhazuagbe Super Eagles forward, Victor Osimhen, has insisted that he did not join Napoli in club record 70million Euros transfer move just for the love of the cash but to give his best and advance his career. Speaking at his first press conference since arriving at Naples from Lille in France, the 2015 FIFA U17 World Cup top scorer, said joining Napoli remains a big leap for his football career. “The highest paid player at Napoli? Being here means that I have taken a big leap. I’m not interested in money. I intend to give my best (for Napoli). ”Joining Napoli is a dream come true. I am happy to play in any role, I’m happy to be here. I have fantastic teammates.” “Being here means that I have made a big leap in career. I want to do well in this blue jersey.” “For a young player like me, motivation is important. The president and the coach made me feel at home immediately. “I have always been convinced that Napoli was the best choice for me and for my future.” Osimhen who mid way into discussion almost backed out due to fears of racism against black players in Italian football, admitted that meeting manager Gennaro Gattuso and club President, Aurelio De Laurentiis changed all that. “Racism issue? I admit I was skeptical, then I went to Naples. My point of view changed after visiting the city and speaking with Gattuso and De Laurentiis. Racism will not be a limit on my career. I will go further thanks to the fans,”he added. “I have an excellent relationship with Gattuso and De Laurentiis, for me they are like fathers. I have received great affection from the fans. “I spoke to Gattuso and De Laurentiis, and that was the moment that I decided to accept Napoli. I received love from them. Motivation is fundamental,” concludes the Nigerian international.
