Ernest Chinwo in Port Harcourt Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike yesterday said his involvement in the campaign for the re-election of Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki would not stall governance and service delivery in his state. Wike, Chairman, Peoples Democratic Party, (PDP) National Campaign Council for Edo 2020 Governorship Election, said the deadline for the completion of the Real Madrid Academy was sacrosanct. He made these clarifications at a session with journalists in Port-Harcourt after inspecting the Real Madrid Academy, Port Harcourt, Woji Road at the New Government Reservation Area and Rebisi Flyover. Speaking on his roles in the forthcoming Edo election, Wike said: “Campaign does not mean that you only go outside the state. We have our own strategy of campaigning. We are liaising with the Edo Local Campaign Organisation on our winning strategies. “So, it does not affect governance and the building of infrastructure to develop the state. The campaign is not distracting me because I am focused on delivering on the promises I made to Rivers people”, he stated. Wike also said the August 2020 deadline for the completion of the Real Madrid Academy is sacrosanct. He, however, stated that the state government“has not decided on the September resumption date for academic activities in the academy in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. “The Real Madrid Academy is almost ready. So, we believe that with the level of work done so far the August deadline will be achievable,” he said. He also expressed hope that Julius Berger would complete Rebisi Flyover by November, three months ahead of the February 2021 expected completion date.
