Canada international Jonathan David, who is the direct replacement for Victor Osimhen at Lille, has described the Super Eagles striker as “exceptional”, but maintained they are different players and he will not be under pressure in taking over from him. Lille broke their transfer record when they paid more than 27 million Euros to Belgian club KAA Gent for David to replace Osimhen, who has moved to Napoli on a record-breaking transfer. However, David, 20, has insisted he is a different player from the Nigeria star. “Osimhen is an exceptional player who has had a great season here, but we are different players and each has their own background,” he told L’Equipe. “Yes, I may have been influenced to opt for Lille because Osimhen also came out of Belgium and we could say that we have a similar background. It played a bit. “Maybe it will go very well for me, as it did for him.” David also said he does not expect the fact that he is replacing Osimhen and his huge transfer fee to put undue pressure on him. “It doesn’t bother me at all. It’s nothing at all.”
