By David-Chyddy Eleke The last is yet to be heard of the rift between Anambra State Governor, Chief Willie Obiano and some traditional rulers in the state who went to Abuja to commend President Muhammad Buhari over some infrastructural project in the South-east, including the Enugu-Onitsha Expressway. This is because while the monarchs who had also travelled to report the governor to the president are still in Abuja after failing to meet President Buhari, the Anambra State House of Assembly has backed Obiano, saying that there was nothing to commend the president about. The lawmakers pointed at the state of Enugu-Onitsha Expressway being constructed by the federal government, saying that it has been abandoned. The Assembly in a resolution it passed yesterday, urged the President to direct the Ministry of Works to cause the contractor, Reynolds Construction Company, to return to site. The lawmakers in the resolution said the Enugu-Onitsha Expressway had been abandoned and it had become a discomfort to road commuters. “We urge the federal government to direct the construction firm handling the contract to go back to site to alleviate the sufferings of the road users. “The expressway is an important Trunk -A highway, known for its heavy vehicular traffic. It was abandoned and became dilapidated for several years and left the users of the deplorable road in griefs.” Contract for the reconstruction of the Anambra State section of the Enugu -Onitsha Expressway was awarded to RCC in November 2018 with a completion period of 42 months. The lawmakers expressed worry that the lockdown and interstate border closures had been lifted by the federal government several weeks ago, yet the contractor had not gone back to site.
