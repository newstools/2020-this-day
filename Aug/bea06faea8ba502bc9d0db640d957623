Anthony Joshua has warned Tyson Fury he wants to ‘break his head’ ahead of their prospective heavyweight Battle of Britain. The rivals have agreed financial terms on a two-fight deal, which has one less hurdle to overcome after Dillian Whyte was removed as the mandatory challenger to Fury’s WBC belt following his knockout defeat by Alexander Povetkin. Both Fury and Joshua are otherwise engaged and must first deal with Deontay Wilder and Kubrat Pulev before settling the argument over who is the greatest heavyweight of their generation, but already AJ is firing the warning shots. “I have a lot of respect for the man, he’s a good family man and a good fighter, but on the other hand, I want to break his head,” Joshua said curtly while appearing on Sky One’s A League Of Their Own. The unified champion then made a forthright prediction about Fury’s fate. ‘First six rounds, I think, well I know I’m going to take him out then,’ he said. ‘I have had a shorter career, so I’m fresher. ‘I’ve been in the deep end longer so I can handle the pressure and I believe I’m going to take him out. ‘Fury drew the first and then rejigged his game plan and took Wilder out and schooled him really but I think I’m faster than Wilder anyway, call it what you want, I believe I’m better.’ Fury is set to defend the world title he stripped Wilder of back in February, either at the back end of this year or early in 2021, and has been cleared by the WBC to take whatever fight he wants to should he come through victorious. Joshua, meanwhile, is scheduled to take on Kubrat Pulev and is hoping to face Fury afterwards to decide the first undisputed heavyweight champion since the early 2000s. Joshua holds the WBA, IBF, WBO, and IBO heavyweight title belts.
