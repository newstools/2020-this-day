Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja The Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary National Convention Planning Committee of the All Progressives Congress (APC) achieved another feat on Monday when it reconciled the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, and the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva. The chairman of the committee and Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, held peace meeting with the duo at the national secretariat of the party as part of the ongoing efforts to reconcile aggrieved members of the party. Amaechi had earlier arrived at the party secretariat around 1:15 pm, but later left after a few minutes, only to return with Buni and Sylva at about 2pm for the closed door meeting that lasted almost an hour. The reconciliatory efforts however paid off when both party chieftains finally agreed to work together after the closed door meeting. Amaechi, who was accompanied by Sylva, told journalists after the peace parley that, “we have agreed that both of us will work together.” But a statement issued Monday by the Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the party, Mr. Yekini Nabena, said both Amaechi and Sylva had agreed to work together to reposition the ruling party in the South-south geo-political zone of the country. He said Buni charged both Amaechi and Sylva to play lead roles in bringing together party members and stakeholders to ensure that the APC is victorious in the forthcoming governorship elections in Edo and Ondo States, as well as legislative by-elections in Bayelsa and Cross River States.
