The Governor of Edo State, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has said that he is determined to deal with people plotting to disrupt the September 19 election in the state. Obaseki spoke during his campaign at Opoji, in Esan Central Local Government Area of the state. He said although he had received intelligence reports to suspend his campaign in Opoji, he decided not to succumb to threats. “While I urge PDP members and supporters not to succumb to threats, we will tame the lions and tigers in Edo with relevant laws of our country,” he said. He assured residents of the area that “adequate security would be provided on election day.” Obaseki also promised the people of the area of the construction of the Opoji-Irrua road that would attract more development to the area if re-elected. Earlier in the month, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had said it would halt the governorship elections in Edo and Ondo states if the actions of political actors threaten law and order. The Cable reported that ahead of the elections in the two states, some political rallies have been marred by violence.
