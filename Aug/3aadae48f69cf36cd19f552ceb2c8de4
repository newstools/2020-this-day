Borussia Dortmund have set a 10 August deadline to agree a deal for forward Jadon Sancho – who is Manchester United’s top summer transfer target – to leave the club. The German club have told United they want in excess of £100m for the 20-year-old England winger. There is no agreement yet on a fee, which would be paid in instalments. Dortmund have set the deadline because they want undisturbed preparation for the 2020-21 Bundesliga season. The new campaign starts on 18 September, with the transfer deadline for international deals on 5 October. Sancho has been at Dortmund for three years, having signed from Manchester Cityin August 2017 for a fee of about £10m. In July, Dortmund beat United to the signing of 17-year-old English midfielder Jude Bellinghamfrom Birmingham City in a deal that could be worth over £30m. They also bought Norway forward Erling Braut Haalandfrom Red Bull Salzburg earlier in the season – another player United tried hard to bring to Old Trafford.
