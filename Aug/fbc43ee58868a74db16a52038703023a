According to him, the software represents a one-stop shop business solution that empowers and equips entrepreneurs and non-for-profit organisations with the tools to manage their businesses without bottlenecks even when employees are working from home. He described the tool as cost effective, easy to implement and use and built with the peculiarities of the business environment in Nigeria and Africa in mind.
