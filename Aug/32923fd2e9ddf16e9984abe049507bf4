The Zambian High Commissioner to Nigeria, His Excellency, Dr. Solomon S. Jere, has denied reference made to his country in a recent publication in THISDAY with the headline: “Concerns Mount over Loan Agreement Clause Waiving Nigeria’s Sovereign Immunity: Experts fear repeal to fate of Zambia, say waiver of immunity, unconstitutional.” High Commissioner Jere said in a statement yesterday, “Your paper wrongly published unfounded information about Zambia. Zambia has never signed any agreement that waives immunity with any country or institution. “Furthermore, Zambia has never lost any institution such as the wrongly cited Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation (ZNBC) or the Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation Limited (ZESCO).” He said, “ZNBC and ZESCO are state owned institutions and no such facility in Zambia has ever at any time been taken over by China, as alleged by your newspaper.”
