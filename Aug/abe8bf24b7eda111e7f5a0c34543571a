In all of the strange stories that elections seem to provide, either as a comment about one of the candidates or to distract from comments about one of the candidates, the weirdest is the reemergence of ones about President Donald Trump’s concerns about low pressure showers. These water saving devices were introduced as one of many environmental initiatives that the president doesn’t seem too familiar with. As he says, “You turn on the shower – if you’re like me, you can’t wash your beautiful hair properly”. One of the few things I share with the president is beautiful but disappearing hair and I gave up on the comb over a long time ago. Surely, he wouldn’t need much more than a thimble of water to wash the remaining hair. Admittedly this also shouldn’t be a great concern with the, hopefully, incoming President Biden although both VPs have decent amounts of hair. Let’s get back to serious reporting about serious issues and leave the fun stories to cat rescues or other positive matters. Dennis Fitzgerald,
