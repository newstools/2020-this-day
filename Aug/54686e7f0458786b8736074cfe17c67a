The Inspector-General of Police (IG), Mohammed Adamu, yesterday said the statutory entry requirements into the Nigeria Police Force remain sacrosanct and would be thoroughly followed in the ongoing Police recruitment screening exercise. A statement by the Force Public Relations Officer, DCP Frank Mba, in Abuja said IG’s reassurance became necessary following news report making the rounds in some sections of the media that the IG has suspended the entry requirement for candidates who applied to join the Nigeria Police Force as Police constables in the ongoing recruitment screening exercise. “The IG, while noting that no one has the powers to alter the conditions for recruitment into the Force – these, having been clearly provided for in Sections 71 – 75 and other relevant sections of the Police Act and Regulations – stated that all candidates who successfully completed the online recruitment registration exercise were invited for physical and credential screening from 24th August 2020 to 6th September 2020 at various venues in States across the Federation and the FCT. The screening officers have been directed to allow all the applicants to participate in the exercise and to recommend their suitability or otherwise in the spirit of transparency, accountability, and fair hearing using the already established benchmarks as contained in the Act. “The IG has commended the screening officers for the hitch-free take-off of the screening exercise at various locations nationwide. He calls on them to uphold a high level of professionalism and observe necessary caution in line with the COVID-19 prevention regulations throughout the period of the exercise. “Meanwhile, as part of conscious efforts to deepen the integrity of the recruitment process, observers and monitors from the Ministry of Police Affairs, the Police Service Commission, and the Federal Character Commission have been invited to provide oversights toward ensuring a credible exercise,” the statement read.
