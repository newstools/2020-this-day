Victor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti An Ekiti State Chief Magistrate Court in Ado Ekiti has sentenced Victor Olawusi, 18, and Miss Mary Idris, 20, to two weeks community service for stage-managing fake kidnapping with the intent to extort money from the girl’s parents. The court declared that their sentences would be supervised by the Ekiti State Judiciary’s chief security officer. The Chief Magistrate Adefunke Anoma, who pronounced the sentence yesterday said: “This again was sadly a sign of high moral decadence in the fabric of our society.” Anoma also recommended two weeks counseling exercise for both of them to be supervised by the court registrar. The chief magistrate said that smacked of immorality and indiscipline for Mary, who is writing an international examination, to leave the comfort of her home and went to stay at a guest house for four days. Mary explained that she went to her boyfriend at Akure for a fun, but later ran into financial hitch to pay transportation fare to Ado Ekiti. She added that this made her sent the alarming message that she has been kidnapped to her parents. The Prosecutor, Ms. Monica Ikebulo, told the court that the act was committed on August 9, 2020, when they conduct themselves in a manner likely to cause breach of peace by concealing their whereabouts and demanded ransom from Mary’s parents on the pretence that she had been kidnapped. The police later investigated and discovered that the abduction was fake and rounded up the culprits for prosecution. The magistrate said that the two sentences would run simultaneously and ordered the culprits are to report back to the court at the expiration of the sentence.
