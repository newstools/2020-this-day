Anthony Joshua says that Mike Tyson’s comeback can “add value” to boxing and has backed the heavyweight legend’s plan to get in the ring again. Tyson, 54, will meet fellow icon Roy Jones Jr in an exhibition bout in Los Angeles on September 12 after posting impressive videos of his preparation over the past few months. Joshua said at a Sky VIP event: “You see a clip on social media and you think: ‘He’s back in action, he’s fighting fit’. “But it’s like an old-time footballer doing a crossbar challenge!
“Tyson hitting pads with ferocious behaviour is second nature to him. But to someone watching from home? It’s like he’s going to rule the heavyweight division. “It’s a passion they both love, it’s what they know. Tyson has been fighting since he was 13. Jones’ dad pushed him to be a great.
“It’s all they know. They haven’t got to compete with the young lions of the division. We’re bigger, stronger, science has improved so we have more technology. “If Tyson wants to come back and fight someone from his era, for the love of the sport? Crack on. “I hope it adds value to the sport we love.”
