The New Nigerian Bar Association (NNBA) has written to the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), informing him of its decision to form the association. In the letter, dated August 28, and signed by Nuhu Ibrahim and Abdulbasit Suleiman, first and second conveners respectively, the faction said the national executive council of the NBA “failed to take into consideration our national interests”. “We are pleased to inform you of the formation of a new Association of Lawyers as above captioned,” the letter read. “The formation of the new association has become imperative and expedient especially flowing from the activities, disposition and most recently, the decision of the Nigerian Bar Association-NEC (National Executive Committee) which apparently failed to take into consideration our national interests and particularly do not promote the unity of our indissoluble country, Nigeria. “Sir, the New Nigerian Bar Association believes in the ideals that bounds (sic) our country together as echoed in our National Anthem: ‘The labours of our heroes past shall never be in vain.” The NNBA said the processes required to set up the association are in place, adding that the AGF will be updated with developments. “You are, however, to be further informed that work is in progress with regards to all the nitty-gritty of the formation of an Association such as this to which we shall keep you updated,” it said. A Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Mike Ozekhome, had said that the plan to carve a faction out of the NBA will not work, vowing that members of the bar will resist any attempt to form a parallel association.
