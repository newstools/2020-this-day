Super Eagles duo of Joe Aribo and Leon Balogun were shock omissions from Glasgow Rangers matchday squad against Livingston in a Scottish Premiership game staged at the Tony Macaroni Arena yesterday evening. Both Nigerian players are nursing injuries that kept them away from the clash with Livingston. This is the first time in the new season that Aribo has not been utilised by the Liverpool legend. Rangers gaffer Steven Gerrard explained to Glasgow Times before kickoff that Aribo was not named in the squad because he suffered a minor training ground injury ahead of the trip to Livingston. “He has a little knock. We are hoping to have him available next weekend. It was too risky to do it today.” Summer signing Balogun also missed the game as a result of a quad injury he suffered in the win against St. Johnstone last Wednesday. Livingston halted Scottish Premiership leaders Rangers’ 100% record as Steven Gerrard’s side missed the chance to go eight points clear of Celtic. With their city rivals idle, Rangers had the chance to push further clear but were frustrated by an obdurate Livingston performance. Max Stryjek made a stunning save from a Borna Barisic free-kick and Ryan Kent twice came close for the visitors, but the point was enough to return Rangers to the summit ahead of Hibernian on goal difference. Livingston, without striker Lyndon Dykes sidelined after a club-record bid was accepted, claimed an unlikely second point of the season. They even came close to snatching more, when Craig Sibbald almost caught out Rangers keeper Jon McLaughlin with an audacious attempt from his own half.
