Ibrahim Shuaibu in Kano A Chief Magistrate Court, sitting at Gidan Murtala, Kano presided over by her Justice Rakiya Lami-Sani yesterday restrained luxurious buses owners from operating in the state. The verdict was passed upon hearing of an exparte application, moved by the Principal State Counsel, Kano State Ministry of Justice, Mutawakkil Muhammad, alongside Secretary/Legal Adviser of Kano State Road Traffic Agency (KAROTA), seeking the court to suspend the operations of luxurious buses in the state pending hearing of the motion. The decision to take the legal action followed the alleged failure of the luxurious bus operators to obey the directive of KAROTA to relocate to Unguwa Uku Motor Park. Reacting to the ruling, the Managing Director of KAROTA, Baffa Babba-Dan Agundi, warned that any luxurious bus owner that violates the court order would be dealt with. He said, despite not obtaining permits to operate in the state, the agency allowed the bus owners to relocate to the new park to continue their businesses but they decided to disobey the agency’s order, which necessitated the legal move to avoid further crisis. He urged those involved to comply with the court order for peace and orderliness in the state, according to a statement issued yesterday by the KAROTA’s spokesman, Nabilusi Abubakar.
