By Onuminya Innocent The Senator representing Sokoto East senatorial district, Sokoto State, in the Senate, Ibrahim Abdullahi Gobir, said the leadership of the Nigerian Senate stood by its earlier call for the sack of the country’s service chiefs. The chairman, Senate Committee on Intelligence stated this yesterday at his residence in Sokoto in an interactive section with journalists in the state. “I’m a member of the ninth Senate, and I cannot back out from our collective decision earlier taken. “If the service chiefs are doing well, there’s no need to call for their sack, but take a look at what happened to the governor of Borno State on his way to Baga, that’s shameful on the part of our security agencies, hence the need to change the military leadership for us to move forward,” he stated. The senator lamented that the recent activities of bandits and kidnappers in the region was alien to them, stressing that North-west region was known for peace, but that now, things have gone out of control. “We never dreamt about the horror brought to the region by the bandits and kidnappers,” he added. He lauded the recent special operation carried out by the Nigerian military which he said has restored peace in the eastern part of the state, urging them to sustain the gesture. According to the senator, “You know, when they have not done well before, I commented, but as I’m talking to you now, the soldiers deployed in my area are doing their best, for now, we have not heard about killings or kidnappings.” The lawmaker, therefore, urged the government to deploy more police to the liberated towns to provide internal security. He said Nigeria is under policed, saying the federal government has to put machinery in place to recruit more policemen. “We know we are facing financial crisis in the country, but security is a constitutional responsibility of every government, and no amount of money spent can said to be too much to achieve that,” Gobir said.
