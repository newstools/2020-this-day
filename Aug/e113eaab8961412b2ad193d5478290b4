The bandits also destroyed musical and public address system worth thousands of naira in Aminchi Baptist Church, located in the community. Wakili who lamented the security situation in rural communities, said he relocated to Damba-Kasaya a couple of months ago after herdsmen sacked his village -Rumana Gbagyi also in Chikun LGA. “They abducted many people in the village before they went to Prince Academy and abducted many of the students who were receiving lessons for their JSS3 examinations. “I cannot say how many people were kidnapped, but they went away with many people,” he said. According to him, “Soldiers who came to the rescue, turned back after some few kilometres, leaving some of the villagers who accompanied them to rescue the victims. “The villagers, not knowing that the soldiers had withdrawn, kept pursuing the bandits in the bush; the bandits fired at them and one person was killed”. The spokesman of the Kaduna State Police Command, Mohammed Jalige, could not be reached as his mobile phone was switched off. Chikun is one of the LGAs in Kaduna State, ravaged by bandits. Many communities in the LGA have been sacked by gunmen suspected to be Fulani herdsmen.
