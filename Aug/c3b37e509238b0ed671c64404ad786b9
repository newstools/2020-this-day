By David-Chyddy Eleke Police in Anambra State have commenced investigation into the case of a woman, Mrs. Calista Ojinnaka, who allegedly committed suicide on July 26, 2020, by hanging self with a rope tied to a ceiling fan in her house in Onitsha. There has been doubt about the claims of the husband to the deceased, Mr. John Ojinnaka, that she had spiritual problem and may have taken her life. The spokesperson of the state Police Public Relations Officer, SP Haruna Mohammed, who spoke with THISDAY yesterday, said the command has commenced a thorough investigation into the matter. Though he declined further comment, he simply said: “Yes, I can only tell you that the case is under investigation to ascertain the actual cause of the incident.” Meanwhile, a source who lives close to the deceased, stated that the husband was the primary suspect, and was still being detained, especially as he ran away from the house to report to the matter to the police, after some neighbours noted that Mrs Ojinnaka could not have committed suicide as her body was not dangling in the air, but was rather found kneeling down at the centre of the room, with a rope on her neck. The deceased had on July 26, 2020, found hanging on a loose rope tied to ceiling fan inside their apartment at No. 2, Uzodinma Street, Fegge, Onitsha. The deceased’s husband, Ojinnaka, told sympathisers, who thronged at his house, that he was shocked to find his wife body dangling on a rope when he returned from shopping for what they would eat. He, however, blamed her action on a spiritual problem. “I woke up this morning in our two-room apartment, where I was with my wife and both of us discussed on how to buy things for the family. Already, my wife has some spiritual problems for some time now. So, I went to buy the things we would eat, and on coming back, I went straight to the room and discovered the lifeless body of my wife hanging on a ceiling fan inside our room,” he had claimed.
