Igbawase Ukumba in Lafia The Governor of Nasarawa State, Abdullahi Sule, yesterday denied that he was part of a purported plan to stop the appointment of former state Deputy Governor, Silas Agara, as chairman of the National Population Commission (NPC). An allegation in an online medium reported that the governor was part of a purported plan to stop the appointment of the former deputy governor into the leadership of the NPC in favour of one Mr. Kura Isa, said to be a Muslim from Kano State. The online medium quoted an unnamed government official to have stated that the state governor and the Chief of Staff told Buhari not to hand over the NPC to a Christian. But in a swift reaction, the governor dismissed the allegations that there was absolutely no iota of truth in those claims, and as such, he condemned the report in its entirety. Reacting in statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Ibrahim Addra, the governor said: “We are equally appalled by the religious slant being introduced at a time all well-meaning citizens are working to build bridges across divides, especially in Nasarawa State. “Matters of appointment of individuals into positions such as the one in question are the preserve of the president, so to suggest pressure from Governor Abdullahi Sule in that respect or an alleged plan is laughable.” Sule continued that his antecedents, predisposition, exposure and world view did not cast him in the mold of a bigot that is being speculated. “The recent appointment of Mr. Henry Omaku, a Christian, as ambassador representing the state negates the impression that the story seeks to create,” Sule concluded.
