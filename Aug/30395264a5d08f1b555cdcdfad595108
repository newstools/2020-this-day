Ahead of the September 19 governorship election in Edo State, a business mogul, Captain Hosa Wells Okunbo (rtd), has stated that an Edo State of the citizens’ dreams is realisable as long as they ensure a hitch-free poll. A statement by Okubo’s Special Adviser, Media, Mr. Samuel Ajayi, quoted Okubo as saying in his Abuja office that the only home he knows and will always cherish is Edo State, adding that a free and violence-free election is the least the state owes her citizens. “I love my state and will always like her progress which can only be guaranteed by capable and responsible leadership. That is what I want Edo citizens to ensure they use their votes to ensure come September 19th,” Okunbo said. He added that he would like to retire home one day and eat a delicacy his grandmother brought him up with. “I would like to eat roasted yam with palm oil which was the delicacy my grandmother brought me up with. Then I can tie my wrapper and go to the palace and make my king laugh,” he added. On attacks on his person by some disgruntled elements, Okunbo said he has chosen to rise above the fray and remain a father to all, adding that as a father to all, he won’t be engaging in banter with those he is supposed to be leading. “I am like a city set on the mountain which cannot be hidden and which will always attract admirers and some foes as well. That is natural. Therefore, you cannot be going into the gutter with pigs for any reason. I am above that. This is no grandstanding but a reflection of my person. “Like I said in my video last week, we have to ensure that we change the mindset of our teeming youths from negativism to positivism. And there is no way we can do that in an atmosphere of rancour and acrimony. Some of us have chosen to rise beyond this and build a nation instead of destroying it,” Okunbo said.
