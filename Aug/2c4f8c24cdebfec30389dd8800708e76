No, avocados do not spread COVID-19 but the people handling them might. The search for a perfect breakfast avocado starts with squeezing them to check for ripeness as the skin color is not reliable enough. After checking a dozen or so the choice is made and the other eleven are left behind for others to check. The wearing of masks is a start, and surely should be compulsory, but we need to think of every possibility to prevent the spread of the virus. Yes, I do not like wearing the masks either, but I want to live and would be ashamed if I had not and someone had become ill. Be a Superhero, put your mask on, although wear your underpants under your pants.
