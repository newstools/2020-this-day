Hammed Shittu in Ilorin No fewer than 18 nurses at the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital (UITH), Kwara State, have tested positive for COVID-19 in the hospital. The Chairman of UITH of the Joint Health Sector Union (JOHESU), Olatunde Olawunmi, who disclosed this in Ilorin yesterday while speaking with journalists, said seven supporting staff (portals) have tested positive for the virus. He also said UITH is yet to have COVID-19 isolation centre, adding however that the management had converted one of the ward at the hospital to a centre. Corroborated by some of the nurses working at the centre, Oluwawumi said many of the nurses working at the centre are not properly kitted. According to him, “Presently, we have about 18 nurses and seven sub-staff who have tested positive to the virus. We want better protection-adequate personal protective equipment (PPEs). What we are due for should be given to us. Also, we are lacking a lot of things. “They (nurses) are being exposed to danger. It is now that they are trying to rectify the issue of PPEs. PPEs have not been given to us, we were only promised. “We have a ward converted to isolation centre at the UITH. We have not got our own isolation centre. The government ought to have built one for us. Based on the increase in the number of patients testing positive to the COVID-19, we had to bring them to treat. “Our agitation is that the ward that has been converted to COVID-19 centre should be properly adjusted to suit the purpose in order not to infect those working there. “People who are working at the centre are not been properly taken care of. Many of them did not sign to work at the isolation centre. They are not protecting them. We have 22 people working at the centre, six cleaners and six portals.”
