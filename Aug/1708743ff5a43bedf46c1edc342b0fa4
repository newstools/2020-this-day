Nume Ekeghe Access Bank Plc has rewarded over 9,000 lucky customers in its DiamondXtra campaign tagged, ‘XtraWins.’ The campaign is to reward customers for saving and transacting through the bank’s digital channels. The XtraWins initiative was done out of the need to encourage customers to remain safe as they carry out their transactions. The initiative is also aimed at rewarding loyal customers for choosing digital channels, giving them the opportunity to win cash prizes for performing transactions daily using the Access Bank USSD code *901# or the AccessMore App. Head, Consumer Banking, Access Bank Plc, Ms Adaeze Umeh, in a statement, explained that the initiative was born out of the need to transform the lives of customers who had been transacting with the bank’s digital platforms especially with nationwide restricted movement in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. She said: “In our own little way of showing appreciation to our customers for their patronage and better returns on their savings, we launched the XtraWins campaign to ensure our loyal customers are rewarded. “We have rewarded more than 100 customers every day and over 1,000 every week with various cash prizes since the beginning of the campaign which started about 10 weeks ago. ” Umeh further said: “The beauty about the Xtrawins campaign is that customers can win repeatedly as long as they keep transacting with our digital channels and carry out the number of transactions required to qualify for the daily draws.”
