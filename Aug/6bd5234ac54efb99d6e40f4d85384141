Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has congratulated the President of the African Development Bank (AfDB), Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, on his re-election to lead the bank for another five-year term. In a statement yesterday, Obaseki said Adesina’s clinching of another term in office was well-deserved, given his performance and immense contribution to repositioning the bank to meet the core and most pressing needs of the African continent in the last five years.
“Congratulations to Adesina on his re-election to lead the AfDB for another term of five years. He continues to be a trailblazer, who has over time proven to be one of the best ambassadors of the Nigerian brand. A brilliant development economist and scholar, Adesina’s re-election is a victory for Nigeria.” He charged Adesina to continue in his brilliant execution of the task to position Africa as the new frontier for economic growth and development, trusting that the policies, reforms and programmes being pursued by the AfDB would benefit the greater population of Africans still grappling with the realities of underdevelopment. He said: “We trust that Adesina, who has started well and given a good account of his stewardship at the bank, will fire on and introduce more innovative programmes to drive growth and development for the downtrodden.”
