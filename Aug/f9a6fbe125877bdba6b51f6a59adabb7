Francis Sardauna in Katsina The Katsina State chapter of the National Association of Nigeria Nurses and Midwives (NANNM) has disowned the two suspected nurses paraded by police in the state, describing them as “fake and imposters.” The state Chairman of the association, Mr. Haruna Mamman, who disclosed this at a press conference yesterday, said the suspects don’t have professional requirements to practice as nurses. The state Police Command had earlier paraded two suspected nurses, Misira Tijjani and Grace Ejigu, as well as one Eucharia Onyema for alleged theft and sale of a newborn baby. The baby was said to be delivered by one Shamsiya Sani of Dandagoro Quarters in Katsina at Okmos Hospital on July 25, 2020. She abandoned the baby after delivery at the hospital because it was conceived out of wedlock. Mamman, at the briefing, said after preliminary investigation by the association, the suspects confirmed that they were not trained nurses but operating illegally in the state. He said: “We visited the hospital and interviewed the proprietor of the hospital (Okmos), Dr. E.E Eze, and our findings revealed that they are fake. Tijjani of Filing Canada Quarters in Katsina and Ejigu of Shagari Low-Cost Housing estate are imposters. “The proprietor of the hospital and the two imposters even admitted that they were not trained and qualified nurses. We complained to the state deputy commissioner of police in whose office they confessed that they were not nurses, whereas a day before, they told the police authorities that they were nurses.” Mamman said the fake nurses would be prosecuted for impersonation and defamation of character “because they are not nurses neither are they members of the association.”
