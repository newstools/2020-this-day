By Martins Ifijeh The Lagos branch of the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) has reversed its sit-at-home order following intervention by the state government and the Nigeria Police Force. Announcing this in a statement Thursday, the Chairman, NMA Lagos, Dr. Saliu Oseni said it had gotten the assurance of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu and the top hierarchy of the police that no health worker will further be harrassed while doing their job. The body had Wednesday commenced an indefinite sit-at-home to protest harrasment by security agencies enforcing COVID-19 curfew in the state. Oseni said: “The leadership of the association has followed the turn of events while monitoring the situation. The Nigerian Police Force has reached out to us to clarify and give assurance of cooperation with all health-workers. This, they have also done in the media. The state governor was exemplary as his timely intervention from the late hours of May 19 helped prevent worsening of the situation. “Above all, the passionate appeal from the good people of Lagos is difficult to resist considering the fact that they will be most hit by the situation. Following a holistic consideration of the above development, we hereby reverse our sit-at-home order and have directed our members to resume work from 6pm today May 21. This affects those on call duty,” he added. He said the doctors in Lagos take seriously the responsibility to partake actively in the fight against COVID-19 and the delivery of quality healthcare to the residents for the entire period of the ongoing lockdown and restriction of movement and beyond. He however called on the state government to ensure clarity at all times, on the ‘exempted status’ of healthcare and other essential workers for the entire period of the ongoing lockdown/restriction of movement. “That the Association will continue to monitor the situation and will not hesitate to take any action to protect the safety of our hardworking members,” he added.
