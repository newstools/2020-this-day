Goddy Egene Women in Finance Nigeria (WIFng), a platform for advocacy, development and networking of women in the financial sector and other financial roles in Nigeria, recently announced its intervention projects to support in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic in Nigeria. According to the organisation, its first round of contributions was termed the WIFng Covid-19 Intervention Food Project which involved the distribution of food packages to indigent Nigerians, specifically widows and elderly persons in Mafoluku, Ijegun and Badiya communities in Lagos. The second round of the Intervention involved supporting the private sector-led Coalition Against Covid-19 (CACOVID) which they executed by giving a donation of N1 million as a contribution towards their activities such as awareness campaigns, the provision of medical facilities, equipment and supplies as well as the distribution of palliatives to the general public spreading across the six geo-political regions of Nigeria. In her words, Chairperson of the organization, Toyin Sanni, said: “Part of our vision at Women in Finance Nigeria is the advocacy and financial empowerment of women so we see this as another opportunity to reach out and be a part of the solution to the fight against Covid19 in Nigeria.” Also commenting, the organisation’s Director of Finance, Oghogho Osula, said:” At WIFng, we are tirelessly doing all we can to ensure that vulnerable women in the communities get the support they need to get through this trying period.” WIFng has mentioned that they would be embarking on a third intervention project which would be to financially support the activities of the YPO (Young President Organisation) COVID-19 Isolation and Treatment Centre located within the premises of Landmark Exhibition Centre in Eti-Osa Local Government Area. The organization hinted that they have more intervention projects up their sleeves which will be executed in due course and they have called for the support of well-meaning individuals and corporate organizations to support these intervention projects to help in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria.
