With gradual return to football starting with the German Bundesliga last weekend and the group training in England, Chukwueze and his teammates have also started training based on the protocols issued by health authorities. The Spanish Government has given teams in the La Liga the permission to begin training in the group of ten, as clubs get set for the restart of the league on June 12. Chukwueze and his Villarreal teammates have since returned to training with the Super Eagles forward sharing pictures from the session with the headline : “Good to be back “. The Spanish La Liga was suspended back in March following the coronavirus pandemic which has ravaged the country and others in Europe and elsewhere in the world. Spain’s Prime Minister, Pedro Sanchez, has said he expects LaLiga to resume “soon” behind closed doors.
