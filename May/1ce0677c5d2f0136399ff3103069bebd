The CEO of U.K lender, Barclays Bank, Jes Staley stated recently that post COVID banking models have changed forever as people get used to working digitally from home making brick and mortar and big offices models unsustainable going forward. It was this new normal that Access CEO Herbert Wigwe attempted to discuss with staff when clips of his presentation was altered to portray him as going for mass sack of employees, according to senior bank officials. According to Mr. Amaechi Okobi, Head of corporate communications of the bank. “The presentation was doctored to give a wrong impression and shared on social media in an attempt to blackmail the bank. We are reviewing all options as we need to support all staff through these challenging times while ensuring efficiency and value in our new normal…We will continue to support all staff and stakeholders,“ he said. According to Staley having thousands of banking workers in big expensive city offices “may be a thing of the past.”
He stated that about 70,000 of Barclays’ staff worldwide are working from home due to coronavirus lockdown measures. An indication that banking has change forever.
