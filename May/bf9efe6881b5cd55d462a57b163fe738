Adibe Emenyonu in Benin-city As part of efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic in Edo State, the state government has intensified screening and testing of residents across the 18 local government areas, screening over 76,640 and testing over 520 persons in the state. The state Commissioner for Health, Dr. Patrick Okundia, who disclosed this in Benin-city, said the ongoing massive screening and testing is a strategy adopted by the state Governor, Godwin Obaseki-led administration to get a clearer picture of the spread of the virus in order to enhance efforts to fight the deadly disease. Okundia, who urged residents to get screened in any of the facilities or mobile screening centres across the state, noted that the improved efforts at screening and testing were responsible for the steady increase in numbers of confirmed cases. He further appealed to all citizens to support the state government efforts towards curtailing the spread of coronavirus by complying with all guidelines, including the stay-at-home and social distancing directives. According to Okundia, “The state government has continued to take serious steps to contain the COVID-19 pandemic as the health and wellbeing of all Edo residents remain top priority for this government. As part of this ramped up measures, we have embarked on massive screening and testing of residents to get a clearer picture of the spread of the virus in order to enhance our efforts and strategies to contain the pandemic. “We have set up over 18 screening centres across the state, with five additional ones at borders with Delta, Ondo and Kogi States and another eight mobile screening centres moving around wards in local government areas to screen and collect samples that fit the case definition for testing. With the model, the state government screens at least 10,000 people daily and collects at least 20 samples for testing.”
