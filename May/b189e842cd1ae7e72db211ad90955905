Today, there is a class of few intelligent women who will give their male counterparts a good run for their money in the country. These executive-level women call the shots in corporate Nigeria, politics and other fields of human endeavour. One of such inspiring women breaking the glass ceiling is none other than Juliet Ehimuan, the newly appointed Non-Executive Director at Nestle Nigeria. Ehiuman, who can be best described as an epitome of beauty and brains, flaunts enviable credentials, both in academics and career. After obtaining a first degree in Engineering from the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ile-Ife in Osun State, she proceeded to the Cambridge University, where she obtained a post-graduate degree in Computer Engineering. Her adventure in the corporate world has become a reference point for aspiring young women in corporate Nigeria. A woman of many parts, she worked as the Performance Monitoring and Quality Assurance supervisor with Shell Petroleum Company for a period of two years from 1995 to 1997. She later joined Microsoft UK as the Program Manager where she oversaw projects for MSN subsidiaries. Luckily, she climbed up the ladder as Business Process Manager for MSN International. She founded her own business known as Strategic Insight Consulting Ltd a few years ago. And in the last few years, she has built for herself a strong brand. In 2011 she was appointed the Country Director for Google Nigeria. A woman of poise and grace, she is also a compassionate soul who has done a lot in the area of service to humanity. However, in spite of her achievements, she remains humble. Her bright personality has won her a wide network of high profile friends from all walks of life.
