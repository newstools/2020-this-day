Ibrahim Oyewale in Lokoja The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Kogi State chapter, has expelled its governorship aspirant in the November 2019 election in the state, Abubakar Ibrahim, from the party for alleged involvement in anti-party activities. Ibrahim, who is also the son of former Governor Ibrahim Idris of the state, was said to have been found guilty of his actions by the disciplinary committee set up by the PDP in Icheke Ward in Omala Local Government Area to investigate allegations against him. The notice of expulsion letter in accordance with chapter 10 and section 57 of the PDP constitution (as amended) signed by the PDP Ward Chairman of Icheke, Sunday Idakwoji, which was made available to journalists in Lokoja yesterday read: “The Disciplinary Committee set up by the PDP in Icheke Ward to investigate allegations against you (Ibrahim) has submitted its report and found you guilty of the offences. “After due consideration of the report and your blunt refusal to appear before the disciplinary committee to defend yourself of the allegations leveled against you, we the members of Icheke Ward Executive Council of PDP at a meeting on April 15, 2020, have unanimously resolved to expel you from our party. “We are by this notice now, therefore, conveying to you the said party resolution that you have been expelled from PDP Icheke Ward.” The petition against Ibrahim which was investigated and found him guilty included: challenging the outcome of the PDP governorship primaries which declared Musa Wada as its candidate in court without resorting to the party as required by the party constitution. This action, according to the petition, is a contravention of section 58(1) (L) of the PDP Constitution (as amended in 2017). Secondly, Ibrahim was alleged to have never participated in the party’s meetings or any other official activities of the party either at the ward or local government level which contravenes section 58(I) (e) of the constitution of the party (as amended, 2017). Thirdly, the records of the party show that Ibrahim is never a financial member of the party at Icheke Ward level which contravenes section 58(I) (f) of the constitution.
