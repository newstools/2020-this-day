The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), yesterday donated thousands of masks, hand gloves, sanitisers and Personal Preventive Equipment, to the Lagos State Government. The NFF donation was presented to the Lagos State Government by the federation’s First Vice President, Barrister Seyi Akinwunmi, supported by executive board member and Head of Committee, Nigeria Women Football League, Aisha Falode. The donation of 3,000 pieces of face masks, 1,000 pair of hand gloves, 1,000 bottles of hand sanitisers and 50 pieces of Personal Preventive Equipment (PPE) covers, were received on behalf of the state by the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Health, Mr. Segun Ogboye, at the Alausa secretariat, Ikeja, Lagos. The NFF Vice President, said the donation was the football federation’s support to Lagos, going by the state’s proactive response to preventive measures against the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. He noted that, going by the immeasurable contributions of the state in nipping the deadly pandemic in the bud, the NFF was compelled to support the state government’s excellent programmes, which had safeguarded the lives of people living in the financial capital of Nigeria. “If the Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, had not proactively responded the way he did to tackle the spread of the Coronavirus, the cases in Nigeria would have been catastrophic, compared to the controlled situation in the country today. “Our donation is in support and solidarity with the state government for the wonderful job done so far to save the lives of Lagosians and by extension, Nigerians. We won’t hesitate to do more if the need arises,” Akinwunmi concluded.
