“When Olagunju Ogunbiyi, a Nigerian Professor and colorectal surgeon at Royal Free Hospital, London, was infected with Covid-19, the best doctors and others battled to save his life.
“According to them, he is not only one of the best hands, but a very nice man, humble and gentle, despite his elevated position.
“As he came out of the hospital to go home, he was greeted by a large gathering of hospital staff – white, black, others – celebrating his recovery.
“Some people are brilliant but all hubris – excessive pride.
“It is important to be good to others in what we say and do. Rather than being ‘energizers,’ some people are ‘drainers,'” the message said. Sent from Yahoo Mail on Android
