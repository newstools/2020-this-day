By Martins Ifijeh At least three of the 256 Nigerians evacuated from Dubai on May 6 have tested positive for COVID-19 in Lagos. Upon arrival in Nigeria, the federal government placed them under isolation for 14 days in a hotel in Lagos where tests were conducted as part of the standard protocol for returnees. Announcing the status of the three evacuees Sunday, the Commissioner for Health, Lagos State, Professor Akin Abayomi, said those who tested positive had been admitted to the COVID-19 care centre for appropriate treatment protocols. He said: “We will continue to adhere strictly to quarantine protocols and enforce necessary precautionary measures in order to contain the spread of the pandemic. “I urge residents, particularly those who recently returned to the country to cooperate with the government’s COVID-19 response team at all times,” he added.
