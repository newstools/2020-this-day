Access Bank has said that its recently launched AccessMore app, which comes with unique features, will not only enable its customers make easier and faster transactions, but will also change the face of banking operations in Africa. According to the bank, the unique features have made the app stand out and earned it a place as the best digital bank in Africa. The cutting edge technology offers tailored and personalised services, ease of use and excellent customer experience. Having merged with the erstwhile Diamond bank, the Bank has deemed it fit to combine both bank’s mobile apps to meet the unique needs of existing customers while delivering top-notch mobile banking experience on a world-class platform. Speaking about the app, CEO of Access Bank Plc, Herbert Wigwe, said: “In a period like this, when we need to be more present and relevant in the lives of our customers, we have risen to the challenge to ensure our customers have access to their funds and can initiate transactions while keeping safe at home”. Going further, he stated that launching the AccessMore app was an attempt to continually give Access Bank customers ‘more’ and as such, the Bank has worked with first-class tech experts to build a mobile app that suits its customers’ lifestyles and meet their financial needs. Some of the features of the new and upgraded bank app include: Dubai Visa application, Flight booking, Target savings, Foreign currency transfers, Account opening for new customers such as personal and corporate, Customisable dashboards, among other features. The bank has announced that as from April to December 2020, it would be rewarding customers who complete ten transactions using either its USSD service or any of its mobile apps, such as old Access Mobile, old Diamond mobile or the new AccessMore app with a brand new car in the quarterly draw. The AccessMore app is available for both iOS and Android users.
