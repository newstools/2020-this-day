By Onuminya Innocent Sokoto state Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal has expressed appreciation to the board and management of the Flour Mills of Nigeria (FMN) Plc for the donation of Personnel Protection Equipment (PPE) to assist in the fight against COVID-19 pandemic in the state. According to Gov. Tambuwal, the FMN’s gesture is “a further demonstration of its friendship” as a company and that of its Chairman, Mr John Coumantaros. The donation, reiterated the governor, “came at a time when we need every support to combat the tide of COVID-19 in the state. It is a good gesture from Mr Coumantaros, an American whose business is yet to be established in Sokoto and is far removed from the problems here.” Tambuwal later handed over the donated items including 1000 N95 masks, 10,000 gloves, 30 coveralls (TVEK), 100 coveralls (no-woven) and 30 goggles, to the Chairman of the Task Force on COVID-19, Dr Muhammad Ali Inname. In a letter attached and presented to the governor by the company representative, the FMN said the donated items were meant “for the protection of health workers in order to ensure their safety. FMN however commended the state government “for the steps taken so far to curb the spread of the novel COVID-19 disease.” “During these trying times, we need to come together as a people to fight the scourge of the COVID-19 virus which is casting a shadow on our way of life in Nigeria and the world,” noted the letter.
