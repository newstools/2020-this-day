There won’t be a big trophy or world rankings at stake; instead, some of the sport’s biggest names will be teeing up this weekend for a greater cause: all proceeds will support COVID-19 relief. TaylorMade Driving Relief, to be broadcast live on SuperSport 1 (Sunday, 07:00 PM), is headlined by Rory McIlroy, Dustin Johnson, Rickie Fowler and Matthew Wolff, who will compete in a team best-ball skins match. The lowest score by each team on the hole wins the skin. All four golfers will donate their time for the 18-hole skins competition, with McIlroy/Johnson playing for the American Nurses Foundation and Fowler/Wolff playing for the CDC Foundation. “I hope that we can provide some respite and entertainment for those tuning in across the globe. Dustin and I will have a lot of fun together and our games will fit well as we push to raise funds and awareness on May 17,” said world number one Rory McIlroy. Regarding safety measures, the PGA will follow all guidelines, executive orders and mandates issued by the state of Florida, Palm Beach County and the city of Juno Beach. SuperSport remains your best choice for all the top action from around the world and will be the first and best source of entertainment for when sporting codes return to fields, tracks and rings around the world.
