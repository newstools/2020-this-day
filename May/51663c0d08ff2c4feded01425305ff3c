The 55th edition of the MFOR indicated an increased trading surplus of ₦3.95billion compared to the ₦1.87billion surplus posted in January 2020. The 111 per cent growth in the month, the report stated, was largely attributable to improved performance of the Nigerian Gas Company (NGC), as a result of its low expenses put at over 100 per cent. Other reasons cited for the increased trading surplus are the reduced deficits post by the downstream units, refineries, as well as the NNPC corporate headquarters.
