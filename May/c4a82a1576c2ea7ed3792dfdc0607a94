By Hammed Shittu Kwara Sate Governor, Alhaji Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq, friday attributed the increase in COVID-19 cases in the state to the influx of people from Lagos and North Western states to Ilorin, the state capital despite the ban on inter-state travels. Abdulrazaq disclosed this in Ilorin while speaking with journalists during an inspection visit to the Sobi Specialist Hospital’s Isolation Centre in Ilorin. The governor was at the centre to monitor health personnel’s compliance with safety protocols. He disclosed that 11 of the cases at the isolation centre were travellers from Lagos and North- west states who were intercepted by security operatives deployed to enforce the ban on interstate travels. He expressed delight that community transmission of COVID-19 had not set in Kwara. He said the government would continue to mount surveillance to prevent travellers from entering into the state. The governor who commended the security agencies for rising to the occasion urged them to do more in order to stop the spread of the disease in the state. In her remarks, the team leader of the front line doctors treating COVID-19 patients in the state, Dr. Lambe Oladeji expressed satisfaction with the Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) provided for them by the state government.
