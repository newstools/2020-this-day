As parts of efforts to key into the global benefits of E-Gaming Sports and make Nigerian sports more viable, Minister of Youth and Sports, Mr. Sunday Dare, has concluded plans to launch Nigeria into the E- Gaming Sports world. Speaking during a webinar on steps to reactivate the sports sector post covid-19 era, Dare said: “We are working on a plan that would produce for the first time an industry-based sports policy that will turn sports into business. “We are on the verge of launching E-Gaming Sports in Nigeria. It is the most suitable for the post Covid-19 era. Globally, it is a $138billion business. “We also plan to develop the Mambila Plateau area to turn it into a training ground for our long-distance runners who are mostly from the North. This is necessary and important considering that long-distance race is an individual, none contact sport that would likely resume soon as the impact of Covid-19 winds down,” stressed the sports minister. Dare further affirmed: “While these are few things we are doing at the Ministry level, we are also keen to learn how other new things can work better.” On youth development, he said more than 2million young entrepreneurs will benefit from training and entrepreneurship programmes to be funded through the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN’s) Federal Government job acquisition initiative. He assured youths that the programme will be launched next week.
