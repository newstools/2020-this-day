Nigeria’s Victor Osimhen and his team mates may have missed out of next season’s UEFA Champions League as the French Ligue 1 season has been declared over The Ligue 1 championship has been frozen following French Government’s directives that no match could be played before September. Lille are fourth on the log and here just a point behind the third-paced Rennes. And yesterday, the French league recommended the freezing of the 2019-20 standings amid the Covid-19 crisis, French sports daily L’Equipe reported. This decision effectively ended the current season with Paris Saint-Germain within a fingertip of being crowned Ligue 1 champions. According to L’Equipe, the LFP’s board ratified the recommendation Thursday afternoon and effectively hand PSG their seventh title in the last eight years. The decision means that second-placed Olympique de Marseille and third-placed Stade Rennais would be in next season’s UEFA Champions League with PSG. Lille, Stade de Reims and Nice would qualify for the Europa League. Amiens and Toulouse would be relegated with Ligue 2 leaders Lorient, and second-placed Lend, promoted to the elite. “I think we have to accept the decisions that have been taken, in all sports and in all countries,” said PSG defender Thilo Kehrer on the club’s website earlier this week. “I think the teams that are at the top of their leagues at the moment deserve to be there. If the decision is taken to call an end to the season then the title will be deserved too.” The LFP was not immediately available for comment.
