In a memo to employees, the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Airtel Nigeria, Mr. Segun Ogunsanya, told employees particularly in Lagos, Ogun State and FCT, the epicenters of Covid-19 infections in Nigeria, to continue to work from home till the end of May. Ogunsanya, urged employees in others parts of the country to observe the nationwide 8pm to 6am curfew, while adhering to whatever restrictions and laws obtainable in the various states of their operation. He charged all the employees to take responsibility for their health and safety as well as that of their families and colleagues by maintaining social distancing, observing the prescribed hygiene protocols and wearing the appropriate masks whenever they are leaving their homes, if they must. Meanwhile, some Airtel outlets are open across the country with reduced number of employees in compliance with government regulations. He charged all the agents in the outlets to ensure contactless interactions whenever possible as they serve the customers. Ogunsanya also urged customers to download the Airtel self-care app to avail themselves of a world of products, services and self-care in problem resolutions. He assured customers that in spite of the challenges, the network is up and running without any major issues. He thanked the Office of the National Security Adviser (NSA) and Inspector General of Police (IGP) for providing security passes for the Engineers to move about freely to ensure uninterrupted network availability. The telecoms company said it would review the situation at the end of the month to determine the next steps with regard to the resumption of work at the offices.
