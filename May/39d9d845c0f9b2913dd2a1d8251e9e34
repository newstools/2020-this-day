Peter Uzoho The National Leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Bola Tinubu, has felicitated with the leader of Afenifere, a Yoruba socio-cultural organisation, Chief Reuben Fasoranti, on his epoch-making 94th birthday, describing him as an epitome of consistency, integrity and a leader by example. Tinubu also hailed the nonagenarian as a man of great repute, accomplished educationist, astute politician, elder-statesman and die-hard Awoist. The former Governor of Lagos State in a congratulatory message issued yesterday by his Media Office and signed by Mr. Tunde Rahman, said: “I most heartily congratulate our father and leader, Pa Reuben Famuyide Fasoranti, the leader of Afenifere, as he turns 94. On this occasion of his birthday, I pay a special tribute to a man of great repute, accomplished educationist, community leader, astute politician, elder-statesman and die-hard Awoist. “What we celebrate is the success story of leadership by example, political consistency, total loyalty to the progressive cause, devotion to principle, integrity, courage of conviction and uncommon contentment. “Chief Fasoranti filled the vacuum left behind by our illustrious pathfinders and cherished leaders, and in post- Chief Abraham Adesanya era, Papa laboured tirelessly to build bridges of unity, accommodation, understanding, reconciliation and harmony in Yorubaland.” He recalled that since Fasoranti placed his hands on the plough in 1951, when he joined the defunct Action Group (AG) as an undergraduate student of the premier University of Ibadan, he had not looked back. According to Tinubu, through thick and thin, Fasoranti has remained a true democrat, a tested, trusted, silent and productive worker in the progressive vineyard, a dependable ally of early leaders and a man of honour.
