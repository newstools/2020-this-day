Three Crowns milk is a leading Nigerian brand from the stable of FrieslandCampina WAMCO, Nigeria’s largest dairy company for more than 60 years. The Company believes that milk is an essential nutrient for every individual. As Nigeria’s leading low cholesterol milk brand, Three Crowns has nourished mothers and their families for more than 30 years with essential vitamins and minerals that support their well-being. Three Crowns is the first milk brand to show care for mothers and acknowledge the important role they play in the family. The brand recognizes that when mothers as primary care givers are themselves taken care of, this directly and positively impacts the care they give to their families. The brand has thus given itself the patriotic task of encouraging women to eat and live healthy, thereby making the family happy. On the corporate social responsibility landscape in Nigeria, the brand has carved an enviable niche for itself through numerous programmes and initiatives which have consistently strengthened the bond between the brand and consumers across all demographics and across Nigeria. Its COVID-19 donations form the latest intervention by Three Crowns milk in conjunction with highly reputable foundations. Lagos Food Bank as an NGO is committed to fighting malnutrition and hunger with a focus on pregnant women, infants, and students in under-served communities. Tahara Collective focuses on the community, economic empowerment, religious education, social support and advocacy. Made Great by God Foundation and the Bayo Omoboriowo Foundation are propelled by an unwavering desire to continually seek improvements in the well-being of their immediate environments and the society at large.
