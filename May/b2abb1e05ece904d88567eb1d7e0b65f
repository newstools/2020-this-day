By Yinka Olatunbosun ‘Remain positive, hopeful and Inquisitive’ is the message from the author of children’s storybook, Igho Goes to Farm, Mr. Anotte Ajeluorou, as he urged children in Nigeria and beyond as the world continues to battle the deadly Coronavirus pandemic that has disrupted daily routines and the educational calendar for children. He congratulated them in marking the Children’s Day, describing them as the most precious and precocious human possessions in their innocence. As a writer of children’s story and father, he expressed concern on the prolonged stay at home for children, adding that the coronavirus disruption is a temporary one.The author, who is also a senior journalist with The Guardian newspaper, Lagos, Nigeria, also tasked children to take advantage of virtual or remote learning currently on offer using all the electronic devices available to them at home. Mr. Ajeluorou also said children could also use the break to learn something new besides academic subjects, like learning to play musical instruments, dance, craft and reading storybooks like Igho Goes to Farm will serve as productive pastime. Mr. Ajeluorou charged state governments to provide virtual learning facilities in schools while the fight against the pandemic is ongoing so as to minimise the loss of academic hours to pupils and students across board.
