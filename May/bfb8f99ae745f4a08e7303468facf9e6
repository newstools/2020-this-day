Adibe Emenyonu in Benin-city The Oba of Benin, His Royal Majesty Oba Ewuare II, yesterday warned individuals, groups and villages with genuine complaints and claims that fall under the purview of the Benin Traditional Council (BTC) to desist from making any form of frivolous complaints and utterances to security agencies in the state. He urged them to exercise utmost restraint, maintain peace and refrain from making such complaints to security agencies, stressing that there are existing established palace structures, processes and procedures for handling such complaints arising from disputes among and between individuals, groups and villages. Speaking at a press conference held in his palace in Benin-city, Oba Ewuare II, who spoke through the Iyase of Benin, Chief Sam Igbe, stated that: “These structures at the moment have been placed on hold as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure that all necessary protocols and advices as stipulated by the government and relevant authorities are adhered to.” The king said: “It is expected that all pre-COVID-19 arrangements maintain the status quo as we all patiently await the lifting or relaxation of the various lockdown protocols and the subsequent resumption and adjudication of complaints emanating from individuals, groups and villages.” According to the Iyase of Benin Kingdom, “His Royal Majesty reiterates that this restraint and maintenance of peace is the minimum sacrifice that all and sundry are expected to make to ensure that the virus currently ravaging the globe is contained for the safety and security of lives and the assurance of public health, pending when activities revert back to normal and where issues pertaining to existing and emerging complaints and disputes shall be resolved in line with established processes and procedures.” The monarch further cautioned that “all individuals, groups and villages which are engaged in this unwholesome practice should desist forthwith,” adding that “it is pertinent to note that failure to heed to this word of caution may lead to a situation where erring individuals and groups indicted for such delinquency will be made to bear the consequences of their actions as stipulated by the provisions of extant laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, and attendant sanctions on line with the Benin traditional customs and norms.” The BTC stated that “It has come to the attention of the Oba’s palace that certain individuals, groups and villages have engaged in making frivolous complaints and claims to various security agencies. These complaints and claims are being communicated to the palace to make the needed clarifications as they border on Benin traditional customs and norms which falls directly under the purview of His Royal Majesty.”
