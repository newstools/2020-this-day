To complement the federal government’s war against Coronavirus, wapTV has released new sets of informative comedy skits, by its Akpan & Oduma and Papa Ajasco brands, to increase awareness on how to prevent, detect, and manage the disease. These new comedy skits are in line with one of the unique things which wapTV is famous for – strategically inserting an educative message into an entertainment content, so the audience can easily and subconsciously understand the intended lesson; otherwise known as “Edutainment”. According to the Managing Director of wapTV, Wole Adenuga, “As the deadly Coronavirus continues to affect the world, it is important for everyone to join hands and work together. This is why, as a Family Entertainment TV Channel, we are playing our part by using our popular Akpan & Oduma and Papa Ajasco brands to spread this much-needed information to different generations of Nigerians through our television and social media platforms.” The Akpan & Oduma and Papa Ajasco Covid-19 Enlightenment skits are currently available to watch worldwide on YouTube: “waptvchannel”; as well as across Nigeria, and several African countries, via wapTV’s extensive network of all major Satellite TV Providers.
