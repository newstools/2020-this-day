With the current shortage in live-action, SuperSport has converted its channels to themed content focusing on the best historical moments – offering viewers the chance to ‘ReLive’ some of the greatest sporting action of all time. This will go to a whole new level today when SuperSport pays tribute to the emotional and triumphant 2012 Africa Cup of Nations success of Zambia with a special broadcast. Hosted by anchors Lwazi Ziqubi and Thomas ‘TK’ Kwenaite, this programme will feature contributions, live via Zoom and Skype, from 2012 AFCON winning coach Herve Renard, Former FAZ President Kalusha Bwalya, 2012 AFCON Zambia captain Christopher Katongo and others. Zambia’s run to glory at the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations was one of the most fascinating and compelling narratives of the continental tournament, with Herve Renard’s team seemingly pulled along by destiny in paying honour to members of the Zambian team which were killed in a plane crash in 1993 near Libreville, Gabon – the venue for the 2012 AFCON final.
