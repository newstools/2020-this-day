Rivers State Governor, Mr. Nyesom Wike, has blamed the rising COVID-19 cases in the state on unscreened oil workers. He said 60 per cent of infections recorded in the state came from such employees returning from rigs. Speaking when the management team of Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited paid him a courtesy visit at Government House, Port Harcourt, the governor said the development accounted for why he insisted that oil workers coming into the state must be tested to know their coronavirus status. Wike said oil remained the mainstay of the economy and clarified all his actions were not targeted at anybody or organisation. He recalled that recently the Nigeria Air Force (NAF) Base, Port Harcourt quarantined 14 oil workers out which three of them tested positive for the virus. He said: “It is not in anybody’s interest to deny people to carry out their official duties. “Oil is the main stay of the economy of Nigeria and without it we that are in this part of the country will find it difficult to function. “My concern is that companies should always notify government of workers they are bringing into the state, so that our health officials can monitor them. “So, all that we are saying is that we should work together. But people bring in politics that Rivers State is difficult; they don’t want any oil exploration; that is because people want to play politics. “People say we don’t want foodstuff and livestock to come into the State. That is not correct. “What we are saying is that human beings should not be hidden with these items.”
