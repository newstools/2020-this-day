By Onuminya Innocent The National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) Sokoto has extended the service year of 17 Batch B stream 1 corps members as a result of abscondment and truancy. The NYSC state Coordinator Philip Enabuere disclosed this in Sokoto on Thursday, stressing that out of the 17, seven are to repeat the service year, while 10 have their service year extended between two weeks to four months. The coordinator added that the state regrettably lost one corps member during the service year. According to Enabuere, two corps members were recommended and ratified for the state government’s award for their outstanding performance during the service year, while three and two others were recommended for local government chairman and Sultan’s award respectively. He commended the outgoing corps members for their selfless service to their various communities despite the Covid-19 pandemic. He further disclosed that at the point of issuing the certificates, the NYSC observed the rules of social distancing, saying not more than 30 certificates were issued at a point. “For us to obey this rule of social distancing, the issuance of certificate would last for 10 days to avoid overcrowding,” he stated. The NYSC boss stated that to enable the outgoing corps members travel to their various states of residence, the NYSC has liaised with the state Covid-19 Taskforce to obtain passes for them. “As part of these, we asked the outgoing corps members to photocopy their identity cards and bring it for signing authorising them to travel. “We have also made arrangement with some transport companies to carry the corps members to various states across the country starting from tomorrow 29, May to 11 June, 2020,” he said.
