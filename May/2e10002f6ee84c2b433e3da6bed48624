The worldwide COVID-19 pandemic is being treated by the world’s leading medical experts and being mistreated by the world’s leading non-medical expert President Donald Trump. Surely the world should follow the advice of medical experts although in the social media environment we are being misled. Donald Trump has apparently stated that he is taking the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a possible protection against coronavirus even though there are warning of possible serious, even fatal side effects. A proper FDA approved medical treatment is researched, tested and checked for side effects long before it is available on the shelves. This is a proper treatment for malaria but as of the moment there is no proof that it works for COVID-19 although some initial testing is being undertaken. Please do not trust the internet for medical advice unless it is an official site. This is not even the worst Trump medical proclamation as that comes from his son Eric who is describing the pandemic as a political smoke screen to prevent his father from campaigning in the manner that he considers the best approach, large crowds full of enthusiastic supporters. None of the 90,000 people who have already died will get to vote for Trump nor anyone else. Eric’s suggestion that …And guess what, after 3 November, coronavirus will magically…’ is offensive and simply wrong. Again, listen to medical experts and not businessmen and never reality television personalities. The is never enough ways to repeat the message – listen to medical experts not politicians and do have the vaccination when it becomes available. Dennis Fitzgerald, Melbourne, Australia
