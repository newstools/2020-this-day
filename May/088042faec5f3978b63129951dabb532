The circular read: “While we continue to monitor the evolvement of the pandemic and its impact on the capital market, all regulated entities are reminded to make adequate disclosures and report on how the pandemic is impacting operations and discharge of services to investors and other stakeholders. “We also wish to assure investors that while efforts are on-going to ensure that capital market services remain accessible, the commission’s priority is the protection of investors. Kindly contact us through sec@sec.gov.ng for complaints and enquiries.” The SEC also stated that following the federal government’s partial easing of the lockdown measures introduced to curb the spread of COVID-19 across Nigeria, the commission has reopened its head office in Abuja. In compliance with the various guidelines issued by relevant authorities, SEC said its office is open to members of the public between 10 a.m. and 1p.m. on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.
