To our Muslim brothers and sisters, I wish you a joyous and meaningful celebration,” he said. Ayandele said that 2020 Eid-el-Fitr celebration was coming at a time when the world was battling with Covid-19 pandemic and thanked Muslims for their sacrifices and prayers for the nation and their decision to celebrate in their homes because of the prevailing pandemic.
