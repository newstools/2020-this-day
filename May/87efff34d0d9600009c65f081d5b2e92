She reiterated that the numerous challenges posed by COVID-19 pandemic have called for support and cooperation of all and sundry. She added: “I therefore, urged all beneficiaries to make proper use of it so that the spread of the virus will be curtailed. Let me use this opportunity to remind parents, particularly mothers that there is yet no cure found for COVID-19. “The only protection against infection with the virus as advised by medical experts is personal hygiene, frequent hand washing, use of face mask and social distancing. As Eid-el-fitr is approaching, parents must ensure that children are not allowed unnecessary visits and social gatherings”. The governor’s wife admonished religious and traditional leaders to be more proactive in sensitising their followers and subjects on the dangers associated with COVID-19 in order to tackle it in the state. On his part, the State COVID-19 Emergency Response Committee Chairman, Mannir Yakubu, who was represented by the Commissioner for Health, Mr. Nuhu Danja, lamented that the novel COVID-19 pandemic had crippled commercial activities in the state. Yakubu, who is also the State Deputy Governor, explained that the state has recorded 281 confirmed cases of the dreaded virus with 13 deaths, hence the need for stakeholders to support government’s effort of eradicating the virus. Also speaking, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Green House Katsina, Mr. Shehu Namaska, explained that the gesture was to cushion the spread of the global health crisis currently ravaging the country.
