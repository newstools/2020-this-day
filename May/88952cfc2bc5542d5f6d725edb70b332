By Nseobong Okon-Ekong Business mogul, Mr. Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim has congratulated the newly appointed Chief of Staff (Cos) to the president, Professor Ibrahim Gambari, describing him as a globally acclaimed diplomat with an equally tremendous respect at home. Olawepo-Hashim who contested in last year’s presidential election commended the president for the appointment, adding that his wide range of experience will surely be brought to bear as a confidant. Noting Gambari is not only recognized globally but “respected in his immediate Ilorin emirate community, where as a worthy Prince he is an inspiration” the businessman described the new CoS as “a compelling example to intellectuals in Northern Nigeria and all forward-looking Nigerians in general” He stressed: “While the office of the chief of Staff is essentially driven by the dictates of the President’s agenda, priorities and schedule, the wealth of experience, skills and competence at the disposal of the newly appointed Chief of staff may provide the Buhari administration an opportunity for reset in the crucial task of uniting and securing Nigeria” Other than this is the need to manage the economy and polity in an era of a global emergency and economic crises, which is why “this appointment is undeniably a good one and I congratulate President Mohammadu Buhari for making it’ Olawepo-Hashim said the CoS is coming on board after a meritorious career as a university professor, minister, public administrator par excellence and as an acclaimed diplomat, which is a further validation of his immense qualities. He continued, “These qualities have stood him out over the years, and it is heartening to see the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria recognizing them once more. The businessman said he has no doubt in his mind that Gambari has the reputable pedigree to contribute one more time, to national development, by supervising the president’s schedules, advising on policies, and remaining as a trusted confidant in the onerous task of governance and nation building. “It is therefore my utmost pleasure to wish him well, as I pray the Almighty God will grant him the grace, wisdom and good health to deliver on this assignment.”
