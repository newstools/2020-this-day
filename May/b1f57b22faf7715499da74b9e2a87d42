Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has declared one Amara Okoro, a nursing mother, wanted after she tested positive and became unreachable. He said Thursday at a press briefing in Benin City, the state capital, that Okoroâ€™s baby had started coughing and urged those with useful information about her whereabouts to report to the relevant security and health agencies. The governor also extended the dusk-to-dawn curfew in the state by 14 days, effective from Thursday, as part of renewed measures to halt the spread of the virus. He added that the government had decided to commence another round of distribution of relief materials to most vulnerable persons to reduce the economic hardship.
