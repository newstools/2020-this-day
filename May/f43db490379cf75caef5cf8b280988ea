High Life with KAYODE ALFRED Like his principal, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, whose generosity and philanthropic activities know no bounds and are widely acknowledged, his Media Adviser Tunde Rahman, former editor and writer, put smiles on the faces of many of his people in Iwo, Osun State recently. It was during the just-ended Ramadan fast. As he is wont to do over the years during the Ramadan season, he reached out to them again. There was, however, a pleasant addition to the package and it was meant to cushion the effect of the rampaging coronavirus pandemic on the people. Along with cash gifts, Rahman distributed over 2,000 crates of eggs and other consumables to the people.
Prominent and influential journalist and publicist with tremendous goodwill, Rahman was previously Editor, THISDAY on Saturday and later Sunday newspaper. He was the go-to-editor at THISDAY during his time owing to his good human relations and warm personality. He pioneered the political arm of THISDAY on Sunday called The CICERO.
