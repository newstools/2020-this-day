One of the clichés commonly referred to is that age, for all the emphasis it engenders, is just a number. That cliché is only true to an extent. The life of Prince Dapo Abiodun, Executive Governor of Ogun State, is a study in context. Since his birth on May 29 1960, Dapo Abiodun has been on the trail to nationwide prestige. One of the descendants of the royal family of Iperu, Prince Abiodun had the privilege of great parenting and a multiplicity of educational instructions. First he studied civil engineering at the Obafemi Awolowo University Ife, Osun State, and then moved to Kennesaw State University, Atlanta Georgia, where he studied Accounting. Aside these, he also holds an honours and doctorate degree in finance from Ekiti State University, Ado Ekiti, Ekiti State and another in business administration from Adeleke University, Ede, Osun State. His might in politics became obvious in 1998 when he was elected to a senatorial position under the aegis of the defunct United Nigeria Congress Party (UNCP). Sometime after that, he introduced the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ogun State. Ever since, Prince Abiodun has experienced temporary defeats in some instances, and successes in others. Until he was elected into the gubernatorial position in 2019, under the auspices of the All Progressives Congress (APC).Prince Abiodun’s ascent to the governorship position began on May the 29th, coincidentally his 59th Birthday. That day had to be a double-header celebration, and so it was. The event, held at the Marquee inside the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library, was something of a novelty. Folks from all walks of life were on ground to celebrate both his 59th year and his new position. It’s almost a year since he started directing the affairs of Ogun State, but it’s also almost a solid 60 years of grace, good fortune and diligence.
