By Adedayo Akinwale The All Progressives Congress (APC) has congratulated Muslims on the successful completion of the 2020 Ramadan fasting and the celebration of Eid-el-Fitri. The National Publicity Secretary, Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu, in a statement issued Saturday, said at this critical period of the nation’s history, the noble virtues of Ramadan should continue to guide everyone and stay safe amid the coronavirus global pandemic. According to him, “As we complete this important religious obligation, we join the Nigerian Muslim community in beseeching Allah to accede to all their prayers and accept their fasting as an act of worship. It is our hope that the important lessons of Ramadan, including personal sacrifice, charity, sobriety and self-discipline would not cease to be part of our ways of life in the months and years ahead. “In our continuous efforts to stem the spread of this virus, the APC urges all Nigerians to adhere to public health guidelines and instructions, including safe distancing, use of masks at public places among others.” He stressed that on the part of the President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration, “no effort is being spared at mitigating the negative impact of the pandemic on our people”.
