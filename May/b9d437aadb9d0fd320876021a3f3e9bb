Describing the current discharges as “the highest so far achieved by the state,” he reiterated that “being Covid-19 positive isn’t a death sentence in any way”. “This development shows that many of those infected by the disease do recover and go about their normal activities. “For this reason, we should avoid stigmatization of any kind of those infected by the virus,” he said. Inname said the Taskforce is doing its best to ensure that it curbs the spread of the disease by screening each of the suspected cases. He also added that the Taskforce is intensifying efforts to trace the contacts of those infected. “Contact tracing is ongoing. We have identified 844 contacts, tested 436 suspected cases and certified that 176 cases are positive,” the commissioner explained.
