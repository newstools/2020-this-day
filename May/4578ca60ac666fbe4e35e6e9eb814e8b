Two doctors and a nurse were on Thursday held hostage by COVID-19 patients at the Kwanar Dawaki Isolation Centre in Kano State. Former chairman of the Nigeria Medical Association (NMA), Kano branch, Aminu Mohammed, stated this on a radio programme yesterday. The health workers were on ward-round when the patients locked them up in a room for hours, according to Mohammed, but the Mohammed said health workers who are battling with inadequate personal protective equipment (PPEs) still have challenges managing hostile patients. He appealed to the public to cooperate with doctors and nurses and not discourage them in the line of duty. However, Head of Kano COVID-19 Technical Response Team Tijjani Husaini, said he was not aware of the incident.
