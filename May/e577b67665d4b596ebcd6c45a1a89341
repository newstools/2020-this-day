Operation ‘Warp Speed’ as announced by President Donald Trump in relation to vaccine development sounds great but it’s wrong. Warp speed is not possible despite what Star Trek promises and is fictional, a concept that seems to apply to many of the president’s announcements. The use of warp speed refers to how fast and thus how far you can travel, not to the development of anything. I am sure that a number of people would like to see Mr Trump travel for even one second at warp speed. It would be an out of this world experience and he would be most of the way to the moon.
