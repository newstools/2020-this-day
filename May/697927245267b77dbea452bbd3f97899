Benjamin Nworie in Abakaliki Ebonyi State Governor, Mr. David Umahi, said he would not allow Almajiris into the state, and consequently banned them in the state. The ban came as the state records 13th case of COVID-19. According to him, “We have recorded 13 coronavirus cases shockingly and surprisingly in the state now. The first treatment centre has a total of 26 facility rooms and in the next seven days, we will be opening ultramodern emergency hospital ward which we are turning to 300-bed isolation centre in Abakaliki.” Umahi also revealed that one of the patients, a three years old child, has recovered from the virus and discharged after he tested negative twice. Speaking during the weekly broadcast on COVID-19, the governor stressed that he was not afraid to say that there would not be Almajiri in the state. Umahi, while speaking on reports of Almajiris being smuggled into the South-east region, also acknowledged the Northern governors for their cooperation and understanding on the issue. He said: “We will not be afraid to say that there will not be Amajiris in Ebonyi State, and I commend the northern governors who said they should go to their state of origin. “We will not allow Amajiris into Ebonyi State. They should go to their state of origin. We have to begin to tell ourselves the truth as a people.” He also banned the rearing of cattle around the new government house located inside the Centenary City in Abakaliki. “I have directed the Chief Security Officer to meet with the security agencies. Please I don’t want to see any cow within the premises of the Centenary City. How can I be struggling with cows to come into the Government House? Please in the entire centenary city, I don’t want to see any cow there. Not just the government house, anywhere in the centenary city; international market, and the mall. This is insulting,” he added.
