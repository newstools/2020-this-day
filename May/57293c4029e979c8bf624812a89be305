By David-Chyddy Eleke The Anambra State Governor, Chief Willie Obiano, has received a 100-bed isolation centre donated to the state by Access Bank PLC in Umueri, Anambra East Local Government Area. The state Deputy Governor, Dr Nkem Okeke, who represented Governor Obiano while inaugurating the project commended the bank for the donation. The centre, which is situated in the Umueri General Hospital, is meant to offer support to the main centre in Onitsha, should there be an escalation of the Covid-19 pandemic in the state. He said: “We thank you for donating this, but it is our wish that we may never use this centre. But if we ever have to do, we pray that every patient who comes here will leave alive and not in a body bag. “The world has been ravaged by Covid-19, and Anambra has its fair share of it, and the government has been working very hard to ensure that the people are safe. “We have distributed palliatives to the people. We have distributed personal protective materials, and we have been doing well to counsel the people on the need to adhere to the safety guidelines issued by NCDC, and we hope that this will be over soon.” The Commissioner for Health, Dr Vincent Okpala, who spoke at the event, said the centre will help the state contain the disease in case of further spread. He noted that the bank surpassed the expectation of the state by providing quality medical equipment. The Regional Head of Access Bank in Anambra State, Mr Uche Iboko, told journalists that the centre is a joint contribution of the bank and Dangote Group, through the Public Sector Coalition Against Covid-19 (CACOVID).
