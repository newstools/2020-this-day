European Champions, Liverpool FC have joined London side, Tottenham Hotspurs in submitting a €70 million (N30 billion) bid for bereaved Lille striker, Victor Osimhen. The 21-year-old, who was brought in last summer by the French club to replace the Arsenal-bound Nicolas Pepe, has filled those shoes impressively with 18 goals in 38 games. Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester United and Tottenham have all been linked in recent months and the latter side reportedly emerged as the mystery club who submitted a £75 million bid for the attacker. Speaking to Radio Kiss Kiss, Italian journalist, Diego De Luca, revealed that Liverpool have now followed suit with Spurs in submitting a sizeable bid for Osimhen. “Victor Osimhen? He is a player owned by Lille,” the journalist said. “The deal is very complicated because there are various teams on the player. “Liverpool and Tottenham have offered 70 million for the player. In the short term, there may be some news on the renewal issue.” Osimhen is said to have snubbed interest from the Serie A and has his heart set on a move to the Premier League or LaLiga. Late on Tuesday evening, there were reports in Italy and France that the Nigerian forward has agreed personal terms with Serie A giants Napoli. Italian media, namely Footmercato, Telefoot and Sport Mediaset claimed that Osimhen who is in Nigeria to mourn his father who died last Saturday has made Napoli his primary objective and worked out personal terms with Director of Sport Cristiano Giuntoli. Although Lille are asking for €80m similar to the amount Arsenal paid to lure Nicolas Pepe to England, transfer market sources insisted that the more realistic price-tag for Osimhen is in the region of €55m.
