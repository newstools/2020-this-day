In its effort to cushion the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the management of Tai Solarin University of Education, Ijagun, Ogun State has donated food items and other protective materials to its host communities. The Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Abayomi Arigbabu, while making the donation, said COVID-19 pandemic has made life unbearable for a large number of households, as it has affected their means of livelihood, thus, the need for the university to show empathy by giving its widow’s mite to them. “The pandemic has ravaged our world so much that many families have suffered lost of livelihood, jobs or cut-in income. In our little way, the university has donated two truck loads of rice, beans and garri with the production of 200ml pocket size hand sanitizers, as well as large number of face masks for the aged and children in the host communities.” The Chairman of the TASUED Host Community Association, Chief M.O Taiwo while receiving the items on behalf of the host communities, commended the university management for its kind gesture. “Words alone cannot be enough to express our profound appreciation to the university. People who think that those in the university belong to a certain class and cannot be reached, we now realise that they really have human feelings and can relate very well with our fears and feelings. It is of note that they are indeed our friends in good times and in bad times,” he said. The host community association comprises 18 different villages within and around the university.
Other members of the management team at the presentation ceremony include the Ag. Registrar, Mr. Tunde Oduwole; the University Librarian, Mrs. Sola Oyesiku; Director, Directorate of Academic Planning and Quality Assurance, (DAPQA), Prof. Niran Adetoro. Others are the Chairman of the Host Community Association, Mr. Taiwo and the Secretary, Mr. Tope Olukoya, among others.
