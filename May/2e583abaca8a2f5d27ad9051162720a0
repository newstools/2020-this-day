As the world marks the International Workers’ Day today, Coronation Merchant Bank Limited is celebrating health workers across the country for the contribution towards the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. The bank disclosed this in a note yesterday. It specially commended all health care workers that are on call today, working long hours and tirelessly trying to flatten the curve of the COVID-19 pandemic. Without them, the country would be overwhelmed by the Coronavirus pandemic but they are risking everything to make sure we conquer the virus, it stated. “Aside from being a day to celebrate workers, “May Day” is also a distress call. Hence, we are calling on all Nigerians to mask up and stay home as much as they can so that the efforts of our health care workers will not be in vain. “Happy Workers’ Day from all of us at Coronation Merchant Bank,” the bank added.
