The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has announced that its rescheduled 76th Annual General Meeting (AGM) and World Air Transport Summit will take place in Amsterdam between November 23rd and 24th November, 2020. IATA’s 76th AGM and World Air Transport Summit would be hosted by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines at the RAI Convention Centre. The dates were selected in anticipation that governments’ restrictions on travel would have been lifted and that the public health authorities in the Netherlands would permit large gatherings at that time. IATA will work with public health authorities to ensure that all precautions are taken for the meeting to be held safely. “The fight against COVID-19 is the world’s top priority. The economic and social cost of beating the virus will be high. The extreme financial difficulty of the airline industry is a prime example of that. In the post-pandemic world, a viable air transport industry will be critical. “It will be a leader in the economic recovery by performing its traditional role of linking people, goods and businesses globally. But we will be a changed industry. “In anticipation that the world will have returned to sufficient normality by November, we will gather the world’s airlines to look ahead together as we address the biggest challenges we have ever faced. Aviation is the business of freedom. We are resilient. And this AGM will help us to build an even stronger future,” said IATA’s Director General and CEO, Alexandre de Juniac. Meanwhile, the global body has called on regulators to take urgent action to help civil aviation operate seamlessly and safely between states during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as to help facilitate the restart when the virus is contained.
