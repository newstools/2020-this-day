In his valedictory speech, Mr Adekoje who assumed office as the President in April 2018 expressed satisfaction that his administration was able to achieve landmark projects despite the inclement operating environment. He attributed this to divine intervention and unflinching support of every member of the Institute. He pledged to continue to support the Institute in whatever capacity and urged members to rally round the in-coming administration for sustainable achievements. “ We tasked ourselves in Council, financially and otherwise; sacrificed a whole lot of our normal privileges, and like true Generals, led the battle from the front. By so doing, we gave inspiration to other members who came out to serve in various committees and other who expressed their support in various other ways,” he said.
