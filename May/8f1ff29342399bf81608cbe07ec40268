The 10th year remembrance of the passing of former President Umaru Musa Yar’Adua, held in the week, precisely May 5, without any form of celebration or marking. No thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic, which has since shut down the entire economic, social and political space! But, at the mention of Yar’Adua, a lot of things come to mind, chief of which is leadership by example. That was a man, who did not have to desperately sell what he stood for but showed it through examples of personal and instructive choices. Sad he didn’t wait long enough to inculcate more of his disciplines and unpretentious goodwill in the people, the few examples he exhibited in the short period he lived will continue to resonate with both the political leadership and the people in general. May his soul continue to rest in peace!
