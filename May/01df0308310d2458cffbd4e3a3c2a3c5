Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja Following media reports that a coalition of Nigerian legal practitioners has filed a class action against the People’s Republic of China over the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on Nigerians, the Asian country has responded that it is also a victim of the pandemic and not a perpetrator or accomplice. The Embassy of China in a statement issued thursday said in the face of a major public health crises and infectious diseases, the international community should stand in solidarity and work together, not resort to mutual accusation or demand retribution and accountability. The Chinese Government noted that since the outbreak of the COVID-19, it has taken the most comprehensive, rigorous and thorough measures to contain its spread and conduct international cooperation in an open, transparent and responsible spirit. China added that in the process, it has made tremendous sacrifices, accumulated valuable experience, and made significant contributions to the global response, adding that the international community bears witness to and applauds China’s efforts and progress. It stated: “On April 27, 2020, some Nigerian media reported that a coalition of Nigerian legal practitioners has filed a class action against the People’s Republic of China over the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on Nigerians. “The virus is a common enemy to all mankind and may strike anytime and anywhere. Like other countries, China is also a victim, not a perpetrator, and even less an accomplice of COVID-19. “Attacking and discrediting other countries from other countries will not save the time and lives lost. At this critical moment, we urge that some Nigerian legal practitioners will do more things to enhance mutual trust and help the pandemic prevention and control in both countries rather than dancing to the tune of a certain country to build up the situation.” China said it is standing with Nigeria in the global fight against COVID-19.
