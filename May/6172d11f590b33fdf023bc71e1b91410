Nigeria-eligible midfielder James Olayinka could see his stay at Northampton cut short, with an imminent return to parent club Arsenal on the cards. The teenager joined the League Two club on a loan deal until the end of the season in January this year, and has appeared in just one competitive game for The Cobblers thus far, starring in a 3-0 victory at home to Scunthorpe United in the league. An injury which he picked up on his debut curtailed him from earning further appearances in the division, and with the mooted cancellation of the League Two 2019-2020 season, he would be expected to be back at the Emirates stadium anytime from now. However, it is envisaged that the youngster could be farmed out again on loan for next season, as he continues to gain valuable senior playing experiences. The talented midfielder has played at Arsenal since he was aged seven, making his Premier League 2 debut at the start of the 2018/19 season at just 17.
