“My angel Tolani and her music made an appearance on CNN Inside Africa this week. So proud, well done!” This was a post – accompanied by a video – put up by billionaire industrialist and philanthropist, Femi Otedola, a few days ago on social network site, Instagram. It is said that loving fathers who provide praise, support and unconditional love, give their daughters the gift of confidence and high self-esteem. Daughters who have these traits grow into happy and successful adults. This is evident in the relationship between Otedola and his three daughters, who have carved a niche for themselves in different ways in the entertainment industry and keep attracting recognition and accolades, by striving for excellence in their individual pursuits. Beautiful and reserved, Tolani Otedola is an accomplished singer and songwriter whose recent feature on CNN’s Inside Africa is confirmation that her silvery voice and evocative lyrics are gaining global appeal. In the feature, Tolani offers a glimpse into her world and how she gets inspired. She sees the bright side in the current global climate and deems it a good time for introspection, writing and creativity. “It’s a good time to be a Nigerian creative,” she said. “People are excited by the art, fashion, music, film that’s coming out of Nigeria.” Tolani is steadily building a reputation as an African songstress to look out for. She is passionate about music, even though she studied Psychology for her first and second degrees at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. However, she was in a band of four at university, and made sure to gain formal education in pursuit of her passion with additional Diplomas in Music & Master Performance from Tech Music School in London. Tolani debuted her music in 2017 at a well-attended and critically-acclaimed performance in Lagos. She has followed that up with singles including ‘Tenderoni’, ‘Liar’, ‘Ba Mi Lo’ and ‘Maybe Baby’.
