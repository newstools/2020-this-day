By James Sowole Worshippers Sunday trooped to churches in Ondo State for service sequel to the state governmentâ€™s guided lift of ban on religious gatherings. Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu had last week announced guided permission for churches and mosques to open for services on Fridays and Sundays respectively, while all other weekly programmes are suspended till further notice in view of the ravaging Covid-19 pandemic. In compliance with the directive and observance of Covid-19 protocols, all worshipers including children wore masks to various churches. In churches visited by THISDAY, facilities were provided for worshippers to wash their hands just as sanitizers were provided for congregants. Similarly, seats were arranged in compliance with the social and physical distancing protocol, while the usual handshake in some churches were suspended. In some churches that have large congregants, structures other than the usual main auditorium were also used by worshipers in the spirit of physical distancing. However, there was no church service at the South-west Region 4 Headquarters of the Mountain of Fire and Miracles off Ilesha Road, Akure. An official, who craves anonymity, said the church did not open as certain things needed to be put in place before service can be conducted. Akeredolu had last week threatened to close any place of worship that failed to abide by the rules on religious activities as laid down when the ban on religious activities was partially lifted.
