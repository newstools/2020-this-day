Real Madrid have reportedly offered four players, including James Rodriguez and Martin Odegaard, to Manchester United in an attempt to sign Paul Pogba. Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane has long been an admirer of the French World Cup winner Pogba, who has missed most of this season with a series of ankle issues. However, Madrid are still keen on signing him and feel a swap deal – also involving Lucas Vazquez and Brahim Diaz – could be an avenue to sign the 27-year-old, according to UK’sThe Sun, though United insist their player is not for sale. The report details that United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is keen to get Pogba reintegrated in the starting XI when football resumes again. Solskjaer wants to pair Pogba with January arrival Bruno Fernandes in the centre of midfield, with both training this week. Pogba has only played twice since September and has not played since Boxing Day, but has used the period in which football has been suspended to recover and get back to full fitness. Madrid are reportedly keen to land key targets this summer but due to the effect of the coronavirus crisis on clubs across Europe financially, the LaLiga side are looking at swap deals as a means of securing transfer targets. Rodriguez, who was signed from Monaco after a successful 2014 World Cup, has never hit the ground running at the Bernabeu, and had a two-year loan at Bayern Munich from 2017-19. Meanwhile, Odegaard was signed as a 16-year-old in January 2015, but has only made two first-team appearances at the club and is currently at his third club on loan in Real Sociedad, after previous spells at SC Heerenveen and Vitesse Arnhem. Attacking midfielder Vazquez came through the youth academy at Madrid.
