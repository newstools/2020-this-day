By David-Chyddy Eleke The Traditional Ruler of Ile–Ife, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi has donated motorised fumigators to the Anambra State Government, to support the state’s effort in combating COVID-19. Oba Ogunwusi who delivered the fumigators at the Governor’s Lodge, Amawbia, through his emissaries, said the donation was because of his long standing friendship with the Governor of Anambra State, Chief Willie Obiano, whom he said had demonstrated sterling leadership qualities since he assumed office.
