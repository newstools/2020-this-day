The items, which included food items, hand sanitisers and face masks were said to have been distributed to over 10,000 people, within the environs of its Victoria Island and Ogba, Ikeja offices. In a statement issued in Lagos, Managing Director, Swift Networks Limited Charles Anudu, was quoted as saying that the company had to be its brother’s keeper, particularly during difficult times like this. According to him, considering that more than 80 person of Nigerians struggle daily to put food on their tables, a lot of people were further challenged and severely con¬strained by the lockdown. Anudu stressed: “Thus, we felt it was also our responsibility to extend a helping hand to the most vulnerable in our society. “The distribution was supervised by personnel from relevant security and health agencies, with recipients also educated on the need to regularly observe safety measures like washing of hands, using hand sanitizers, use of face masks, personal hygiene, social distancing and hospital visit if they feel unwell.”
