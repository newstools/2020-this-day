The Economic Sustainability Committee (ESC), headed by Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, yesterday met with members of the Presidential Economic Advisory Council (PEAC) over a sustainability plan by the committee. The committee was inaugurated on April 2 to tackle the economic challenges and fallouts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Senior Special Assistant to the Vice President on Media and Publicity, Mr. Laolu Akande, in a series of tweets, stated that the committee would submit its report to the President. Akande said, “As part of the work of the Economic Sustainability Committee chaired by VP Osinbajo, members of Economic Advisory Council were invited to a meeting today for their inputs into the committee’s forthcoming report to the President. “The goals of the report – the Sustainability Plan – include to stimulate significant local production, save jobs, create new ones and also protect the most vulnerable and the working poor. “It’s about turning the current challenges into great opportunities for Nigerians and Nigeria in line with Mr. President’s vision.” The Vice President’s spokesman added that members of the ESC and PEAC, and several ministers were also part of the videoconference anchored from the Presidential Villa. “ESC’s engagement with the PEAC creates synergy and effective coordination as Nigeria confronts what is clearly a serious economic situation,” he said.
