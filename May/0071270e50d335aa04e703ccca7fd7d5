Arik Air has given out palliatives to some communities in Lagos State to cushion the effect of the lockdown occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic. The items donated were mainly food such as rice and beans. The areas covered by the airline in the corporate social responsibility intervention were Ewu-Tuntun/Mafoluku community around the Murtala Muhammed Airport and Arigbanla community in Orile-Agege, both in Lagos. The presentation of the food items was made on behalf of the management of Arik Air by a team led by the airline’s Head of Business, Central/West Africa, Sylvester Egogo and Manager PR & Communications, Adebanji Ola. The Chief Executive Officer of Arik Air, Captain Roy Ilegbodu said the donation of food items to the communities was part of the airline’s contribution to government’s efforts at ameliorating the impact of the pandemic on the most vulnerable in the society. Receiving the items, the representative of the Ewu-Tuntun/Mafoloku community and Chairman of Abolaji/Osundeyi Community Development Association (CDA), Nathaniel Osho, commended Arik Air for its show of love and promised that the items would get to the poorest of the poor in the community. At Orile Agege, the First Vice Chairman of Ifelodun CDA, Abe Kehinde, described the airline’s move as commendable and worthy of emulation.
“This is the first time we are receiving such items in this community and we are grateful,” Kehinde said.
