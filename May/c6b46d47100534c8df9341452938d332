The Federal government has impounded an aircraft belonging to Flair Aviation, a United Kingdom based aviation company for operating a commercial flight as against the humanitarian operations it was given approval to operate to Nigeria. Aviation Minister, Sen. Hadi Sirika, announced this on his official twitter handle @hadisirika Sunday. He said the crew of the flight were also being interrogated, adding that there will be maximum penalty for the offence. “COVID-19. Flair Aviation, a UK company, was given approval for humanitarian operations but regrettably we caught them conducting commercial flights. This is callous! The craft is impounded, crew being interrogated. There shall be maximum penalty. Wrong time to try our resolve!”, the minister tweeted.
