Domestic institutional investors traded N72.46 billion worth of shares in March, while domestic retail investors accounted for N60.23 billion, up from N47.60 billion and N29.56 billion respectively. Last year, the NSE organised workshops as part of measures to encourage retail investors to play in the Nigerian capital market.
The Divisional Head, Trading Business, NSE, Mr. Jude Chiemeka, had said the low level of domestic investors was below expectation, hence the need to increase the number. “Currently, there are about three million retail investors in the Nigerian capital market, representing only three per cent of the total adult population in the country. The exchange recognises the need to improve investor participation, and is leveraging recent capital market initiatives such as the know your customers(KYC) requirements for capital market investments, as well as promoting the introduction of globally competitive investment products with low entry thresholds, to achieve financial inclusion goals,” he said. According to him, these initiatives have begun to yield positive results as the market has in recent times witnessed an upturn in retail investor participation. He noted that financial inclusion was a priority of stakeholders in the capital market, stressing that the “NSE makes it a primary concern to contribute towards the achievement of Nigeria’s National Financial Inclusion Strategy of reducing the proportion of adult Nigerians that are ﬁnancially excluded to 20 per cent in the year 2020.” The NSE official had said aside from understanding capital market products as individual investors, the workshop was intended to aid the appreciation of basic investment principles, deepen understanding of personal financial management, promote financial literacy and gradually help in restoring confidence in the Nigerian capital market across the youth demography, through dissemination of information about investment principles which can be used to leverage the capital market to grow and preserve wealth.
