It was gathered that the bandits stormed the local government headquarters riding on 27 motorcycles and shooting sporadically making the residents to scamper for safety even in the thick of the dark. “They went from house to house knocking on the doors for the occupants to open the doors for them. “The doors to houses not opened were forced opened and the occupants beaten mercilessly before their property were made away with,” an eyewitness told THISDAY. According to reports, the operation by the bandits started late on Wednesday at Uregi town a few kilometres from Kagara where several people were kidnapped and hundreds of cattle rustled.

We cannot do anything with peace of mind. We are always afraid that we will be attacked.” Efforts to get the Niger State Emergency Management Agency officials were abortive as their lines were not going through. Several calls also made to the state Police Command Public Relations Officer, ASP Wasiu Abiodun, were not returned.
