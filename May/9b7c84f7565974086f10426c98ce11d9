All public spaces will be sanitized at intervals every day. Tailor-made service Kia encourages its clients to call their preferred dealership beforehand – whether it is to attend to a vehicle repair, book a service appointment or schedule a showroom visit – as it will enable the dealership to stagger visitors, thereby keeping the number of people inside the showroom or service centres to acceptable levels, as well as negating any waiting time at our facilities. “Despite the lengths we’ve gone to, to ensure everyone’s safety, we appreciate that some customers might still be hesitant to engage physically in a public space, which is why both our showrooms and service centres have been adequately resourced and mandated to provide customers with tailor-made service solutions that give them the necessary comfort to purchase or service with us,” comments Tikolo. “We are open to offering you an alternative to visiting the showroom through our digital platforms.
