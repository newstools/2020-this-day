The Chairman of Association of Resident Doctors at the Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital (AKTH), Dr Abukakar Nagona yesterday disclosed that no fewer than 10 medical doctors have tested positive for COVID-19 at the Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital. Nagona, who made the confirmation to newsmen in Kano, said the doctors were treating patients, who came to the hospital with symptoms later discovered to be COViD-19. “Eight of the infected doctors have been sent to Isolation centres, while the remaining two have gone into self-isolation in their respective homes, as they were yet to develop any symptoms,” he said. However, he attributed the vulnerability of the doctors to “the absence of adequate Personal Protective equipment, as well as the failure of patients to wear face masks when coming to the hospital for treatment”.
