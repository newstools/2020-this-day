Sports Facility Expert, Ebi Egbe, has hailed the recent appointment of Dr Patrick Ekeji, former Director General of defunct National Sports Commission (NSC) as the Deputy Chief of Staff to Imo State Governor, Hope Uzodimma. Egbe who is the Chief Executive Officer of Monimichelle, in a statement made available to the media in Yenagoa, noted that Ekeji, an ex international and football legend is an astute administrator who would add value to Imo State government. “Ekeji’s appointment as Deputy Chief of Staff to His Excellency Hope Uzodimma is well deserved. Ekeji is an sound and astute administrator that would add value to governance in Imo state. Hope Uzodimma has brought on board a man that would help him drive his vision of accelerated development of Imo State,” Egbe stated. He pointed out that Ekeji’s appointment would also rob off positively on Imo sports, since sports remains Ekeji’s primary constituency. “Ekeji may not be holding a sports position, but he would definitely not abandon his primary constituency which is good for Imo sports. Again, he is working with a governor that is a sportsman…a former President of the Nigeria Wrestling Federation (NWF). Imo sports is definitely going to enjoy a new lease of life under the administration of Governor Hope Uzodimma,” Egbe concluded.
