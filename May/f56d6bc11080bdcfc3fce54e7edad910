The review of the ATS from the pre-existing classroom training to a virtual set up is just one of our efforts in leveraging our digital assets to maintain the flow of information and market activity; deliver on our mandate for capacity building; and continue to enhance stakeholders’ experience in our market.” Also speaking, the Head, Trading Business Division, NSE, Mr. Jude Chiemeka,said:“The impact of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has necessitated that we come up with more digital friendly solutions to keep activities in the market moving.

The NSE is pleased about the keen interest we have seen and will continue to provide learning and trading opportunities that will benefit our stakeholders.”
