By Martins Ifijeh The recently sacked Commissioner for Works and Infrastructure in Kano State, Mu’azu Magaji has tested positive for COVID-19. His Special Adviser, Muslihu Yusuf Ali, has blamed his positive status on his mingling with the Kano State COVID-19 Task Force, officials of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and the state’s health commissioner. Magaji was relieved of his job in April by the Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, for making ‘indecent comments’ about the death of the Chief of Staff to the President, Abba Kyari. In a Facebook post Magaji made through his official account, Thursday, he said: “The result of the COVID-19 test carried out by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control on me came back positive.” His SA, Ali in a statement Thursday said his boss underwent the test after experiencing respiratory symptoms including cough, headache and fever. He said: “Mr Magaji have been complaining of fever, headache and cough for almost one week until when he called the NCDC hotline three days back for COVID-19 test. The results came up positive and they had to shift him immediately to Muhammadu Buhari Hospital Giginyu on isolation as one of the COVID-19 protocol. “His tireles efforts on developmental projects in Kano within very brief time as commissioner of works and infrastructure in Ganduje administration will never be forgotten by Kano citizens and Nigeria at large. “Also more unforgettably is the most recent achievement he laid as a member of the Kano State Task Force Commitee on COVID-19 where he had a fine coordination and supervision of all isolation centers in Kano. ‘The mingling of the workaholic commissioner hand in hand with commissioner of health, member of COVID-19 task force, health professionals, and NCDC caused him to be at high risk of the disease,” he said. He said Allah will grant him and other persons infected in Kano quick recovery.
