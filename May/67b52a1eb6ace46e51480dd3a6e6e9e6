Professional Footballers’ Association (PFA) Chief Executive, Gordon Taylor, has suggested halves of less than 45 minutes could be considered when football resumes. Discussions about the English Premier League’s return are ongoing but Taylor said that players are “concerned” about safety. “They are not stupid,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Tuesday afternoon. “They would have to be satisfied that it is safe.” The Premier League said the idea is “not on the table”. Football League Chairman, Rick Parry said “there haven’t been any discussions about it”, but did tell a Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee hearing: “I don’t think we should be ruling out any creative ideas.” The Premier League is hopeful of a potential 8 June resumption. No set date has been given for the EFL, but Parry said the current season must be concluded by July 31. Taylor was talking about how to combat player fatigue, with so many games expected to be played in a short period. He told the BBC: “We don’t know the future but we do know what propositions have been put, what ideas have been put – the possibility of having more substitutes, games possibly not being the full 45 minutes each way, talks of neutral stadiums. “Ideally, you want to keep the integrity of the competition, and of course, that was about playing home and away and having the same squad of players as before it was suspended. “The very fact that you are in professional sport, you need to be very resilient. You need to be able to bounce back because you’ll get more setbacks than you will good times, and I would like to think that’s how my members are. “So it remains in process and we shall just have to wait and see, and look at it on a day by day basis and see if it’s achievable. But if we don’t try, then it’s never going to be achievable. “There’s lots of points to be made, but above all, can the seasons be completed and can they be completed safely?”
