By Bennett Oghifo A Federal High Court in Lagos yesterday ordered retired Brigadier-General John Onimisi Ozigi (rtd) to refund the sum of N426.7 million to the federal government, following a suit brought against him by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). The trial Judge, Muslim Hassan said the respondents, Brigadier-General Ozigi (rtd) and Diamond Head Ventures and Dev. Company Ltd, failed to satisfy the court with concrete evidence why the money, suspected to be proceeds of unlawful activities, should not be forfeited to the government. Justice Hassan said the money linked to the retired Brigadier-General was above his monthly salary of N750,000. “The application has met the conditions stipulated in Section 17 of the Advanced Fee Fraud and other related offences Act “The application is meritorious and it is hereby granted as prayed,” Justice Hassan said. The judgement followed a motion filed by Ekereuwem Anana, counsel to the EFCC.
