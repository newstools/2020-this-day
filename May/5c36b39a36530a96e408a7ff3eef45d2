By Udora Orizu In commemoration of this year’s Worker’s Day, a member of the House of Representatives, Hon. Omoregie Ogbeide-Ihama has commended health workers across the country in the forefront of the Covid-19 battle, for their selfless service to the nation. Ogbeide-Ihama who represents Oredo federal constituency in Edo state, in a statement said despite the fact that the celebration had been dampened by the coronavirus pandemic, Nigerian workers deserves to be commended for their dedication and commitment to driving the engine that keeps the nation running. The lawmaker also said this year’s May Day presents a good opportunity for the leadership to begin to re-examine the issues of workers’ welfare, working conditions, re-organization of administrative structures and systems. He said, “In ideal circumstances, i should begin by saying Happy Workers Day; but these are not ideal circumstances. Despite the situation and in line with this year’s theme ‘Stop the Pandemic’ it was important to celebrate Nigerian workers, most especially those in the health sector working to protect citizens from a ravaging enemy.” “The present pandemic has clouded our celebrations with an atmosphere of confusion, fear for our health and those of our families, expectations of a bleak economy post-covid-19, and uncertainty about whether workers will still have jobs when this is over.” “In spite of all the negative permutations, two things are key; one, the spirit of the Edo worker is strong and resolute and their passion and readiness to discharge their duties is unquestionable. Two, if provided the right leadership to work with, most of the concerns mentioned earlier would not be as troubling as they are presently.” “Times like this should awaken us to the need for creative and innovative thinking targeted at improving the lots of our dear workers. I assure you that with fresh ideas and new ways of thinking, the future holds hope and prosperity for you and your loved ones.
