President Muhammadu Buhari Sunday joined his family for Eid prayers at their residence in the State House Abuja. In one of the photographs released by the President’s media office, an Islamic cleric was seen leading the Eid prayer on the lawn of the State House. The president sat on a foldable chair, flanked by seven men who sat on prayer mats. Another photograph showed the first lady, Aisha, and her four daughters sitting on mats during the Eid prayer. While all others wore masks during the Eid prayer session, Buhari and the first lady did not. Social distancing rule was however observed during the prayer session. Photographs were later taken by the first famiy inside their residence. Yusuf, the president’s son, appeared in the two family photographs taken inside their residence. See images below.
