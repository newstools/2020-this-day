Speaking on the report, Ado explained that the loan was not a new request, rather to convert an existing request from foreign sources to local sources. He said: “This item is already captured in the 2020 Act. It was provided in the budget. All they want is to take the facilities from local sources. During the leadership interface with the Finance Minister, we were assured that the rate will be favourable, and the request was agreed at the leadership meeting.” The approval was speedily given by the Green Chamber in a few minutes.
