POETRY I miss the simple things But life is no longer as simple… The handshake is approaching extinction The hug is endangered The smile is now measured out in peeks We are closer in grief United in fear and loss But we cannot console ourselves To survive as a society We must be physically apart The former eccentricities Are the new normal 6 feet apart Is better than 6 feet under Muffled speech Is better Than the dumbness of a corpse Wash your hands Sanitize all surfaces We have all become ninjas Caution the Katana To slay the enemy’s progression Now we have to see beauty In a whole new light The world has changed But the change Is more a return to simplicity The eyes will have to speak more Reflecting our smiles or pain Listening is no longer an art It is by default We are apart But we are more united We will beat this You and I And rejoice collectively With a bow, with wave With a twinkle in the eye While soberly, Physically, cautiously distanced I miss the simple days But I am grateful For the days we still have Caution may not be comfortable But being able to see loved ones again Makes up for every discomfort, Makes these the best of days (Poem by Femi Onakanren)
