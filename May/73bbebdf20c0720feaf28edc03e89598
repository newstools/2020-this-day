Chuks Okocha in Abuja Dangote Industries Ltd has distanced itself from any involvement in the haulage of youths (Almajirai) from Northern Nigeria to the South-east. The company in a letter it addressed to the President General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Chief John Nnia Nwodo, dated May 27, 2020 and entitled, “Allegation of illegal haulage against Dangote Industries Limited,” profusely denied any involvement. President-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Chief Nwodo had recently expressed concern over the involvement of vehicles belonging to Dangote Industries in conveying the almajirai to the South-east and advised the company to halt it. But the company in letter signed by the Group Chief Branding and Communications officer, Mr. Anthony Chiejina, said “it categorically denies these spurious and misleading allegations, and hereby calls upon the public to disregard such report.” The company however solicited the assistance of the general public in the fight to rid the organisation of illegal haulage activities being perpetrated by some unscrupulous persons using its trucks. According the company, the Dangote trucks are permitted to transport only the following materials: Dangote Cement, limestone, high-grade Gypsum and coal as well as Sugar, Dangote Salt and Dano seasoning and Dangote- branded sacks and bags. In the letter to Ohanaeze, the company alerted the general public to report any Dangote Truck driver involved in illegal haulage supported with credible evidence of such act. In the letter sighted by THISDAY, the company said it had alerted police and other law enforcement agents to arrest any Dangote driver and his assistant caught in the act.
