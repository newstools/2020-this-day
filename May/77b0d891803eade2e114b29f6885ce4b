By Ibrahim Shuaibu in Kano The National Association of Nigeria Nurses and Midwives says 18 nurses have tested positive for coronavirus in Kano. The Chairman of Kano branch of the association, Mr Ibrahim Maikarfi Muhammad, disclosed this to reporters on Wednesday in Kano. Muhammad said 86 samples of nurses were taken and results of 18 indicated that they tested positive. The chairman said nine of them were from National Orthopedic Hospital Dala, seven from Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital and two from state hospitals. Muhammad appealed to the government to provide Personal Protective Equipment for health professionals so that they can conveniently discharge their responsibility. ‘’Our members needed to be protected as they are ready to support the fight against COVID-19, considering that we are in the fore front of the fight,” said Maikarfi. Nigerian Medical Association Chairman, Dr Sanusi Bala, had earlier disclosed that 34 medical doctors had also tested positive for COVID-19 in Kano.
