However, due to the need to protect its stakeholders and members of staff, the commission issued some guidelines among which is that stakeholders are strongly advised to use our various e-channels to communicate and interact with the commission and that physical visits should only be considered as a last resort. Other guidelines issued by the SEC are that all meetings and events will be convened electronically until further notice; all filings shall continue to be received electronically; all visitors will be subjected to temperature checks and hand sanitization before gaining access to the commission’s building; and also visitors are expected to wear facemasks and abide by social distancing rules while present in the commission’s facility.
