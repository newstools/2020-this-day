Peter Uzoho The Adunni of Yorubaland, Delta and Edo states, Chief Sarafa Tunji Ishola, has commiserated with the family of the late Chief Imam of Egbaland, Sheikh Liadi Ayinde Orunsolu, and other members of the Muslim community over the passing on of the cleric. In a condolence message issued yesterday and personally signed by him, Ishola said the late Orunsolu was a titan during his 98 years on earth, adding that he would be remembered over a long time for the significant role he played in bringing together all Muslim communities in Egbaland. “Sheikh Liadi was also a key factor in the unity and cooperation that have prevailed among the Muslim communities in Ogun State and Yorubaland. At the time of his death, he was the President of the League of Imams and Alfas, Ogun State. “A man of peace, profound knowledge and immense wisdom, his contributions to inter-religious harmony is noteworthy. Successive administrations in Ogun State have benefited immensely from his frank, honest and fatherly contributions. There is no gainsaying that he will be greatly missed by the entire people of Ogun State,” Ishola said. He prayed God to grant the family and the Egba Muslim community the strength to bear the loss of the colossus who was a father to all and sundry, and reward his uncommon services to man and his creator with Aljanat Firdaus.
