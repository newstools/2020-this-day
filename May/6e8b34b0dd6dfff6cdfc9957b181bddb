By Francis Sardauna The Katsina State Government has nullified the lockdown order imposed on Mani and Safana Local Government Areas of the state. The state Governor, Aminu Bello Masari, approved the immediate nullification of the stay-at-home order in a statement issued by the Secretary to State Government (SSG), Dr. Mustapha Inuwa, on Friday. The lockdown order was imposed on the council areas on April 23rd and 25, 2020 following the confirmation of Covid-19 cases in the areas by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). According to the statement, “Governor Aminu Bello Masari made the pronouncement today (Friday) after receiving a report that no new case was reported and those confirmed positive cases that led to the lockdown of the two local government areas have fully recovered. “However, the governor appealed to the people of the affected areas and the general public to continue to maintain social distancing and strictly adhere to the use of mask and other security and health guidelines to contain the spread of the pandemic.”
