The Emir of Bauchi, Alhaji Rilwan Sulaiman, has canceled the annual durbar by royal horsemen, popularly known as “hawan daushe”, held a day after Eid-el-fitr (Sallah) in Bauchi. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported that the horse parade is a tourism event organised by Emirs in the North, which attracts thousands of people during the sallah festivities. Sulaiman said at the stakeholders’ meeting with the state government held wednesday in Bauchi that the cancellation of the event was necessitated by the global Coronavirus pandemic. He said the world was faced with the dreaded coronavirus disease, which had caused untold hardship to the people. “We will do everything possible to see that we stop the spread of the virus in our society. “Therefore, the annual “ daushe” horse parade is cancelled to ensure adherence to social distancing and discourage all forms of social gathering in the state,” he said.
