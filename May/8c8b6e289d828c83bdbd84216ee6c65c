Laleye Dipo in Minna The Niger State Government has barred women and children from the Ed-el-fitri prayers scheduled to mark the end of this year’s Ramadan. The state government also stated that the prayers must be “brief and precise.” Muslims throughout the country are expected to mark the end of the one month of fasting either Saturday or Sunday depending on the sighting of the moon. These measures were announced by the Director General of Niger State Bureau for Religious Affairs, Mr. Umar Farooq Abdullahi, who directed that: “The prayers are to be observed in various Juma’at Mosques across the state with recitation of a short Surat (chapters) and a brief sermon. Abdullahi said: “Medical guidelines, such as hand washing or hand sanitising, social distancing, and the use of face-masks must be adhered to. “Muslims are to go home and stay immediately after prayers because all forms of gatherings are prohibited during the festival. “The public is reminded of the dangers of the COVID’19, and therefore requested to continue to be conscious of the pandemic as a threat to life, property and security.” The statement was issued after due consultations with Traditional Councils and Islamic Scholars in the state” and approval given by the state governor .
