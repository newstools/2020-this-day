By Francis Sardauna The Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar has deployed additional 60 Nigerian Air Force (NAF) Special Forces to Katsina State to tackle the prevailing attacks by bandits in the state. The action followed a recent attack on some communities in Batsari and Jibia Local Government Areas of the state, where many people were massacred. Addressing the troops, Abubakar said the 60 personnel comprising three officers and 57 men were to support the ongoing Operation Hadarin Daji in the state. He explained that the Special Forces would complement the efforts of other security forces on ground to prevent further attacks on innocent citizens. Represented by the Air Officer commanding Special Operations Command, AVM Charles Ohwo, he assured residents of the state that bloodletting orchestrated by bandits and kidnappers would soon end. He urged the personnel to be committed and effectively utilise their experience and training to protect the lives and properties of the people of Katsina State. The Air Force chief explained that troops under operation Hadarin Daji had killed scores of bandits within 48 hours of their last operations in Zamfara and Katsina states, saying the number of bandits killed would be unveil soon. “The stage where we are now need special forces to be injected into the fight against bandits. So, the Chief of Air Staff has deployed 60 Special Forces personnel, 3 officers and 57 well trained men. “Just last week, the Chief of Air Staff graduated 94 Special Forces and 34 Combat Search and Rescue personnel. So, this 60 is to support the operation Hadarin Daji towards ensuring that the fight against bandits is brought to a complete end,” he explained.
