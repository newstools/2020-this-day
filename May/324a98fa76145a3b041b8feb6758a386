By Onuminya Innocent The Sokoto State Government has reviewed the statewide curfew imposed on the state in line with the federal governmentâ€™s directive from 10 pm to 6 am daily. The decision was taken by the Joint Security Council and the state Task Force on Covid-19 at a meeting presided over by the state Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal. Penultimate week, the state government had imposed an 8 pm to 6 am curfew in its effort to curtail the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. However, the state government, according to the Chairman of the Taskforce on Covid-19, Dr Muhammad Ali Inname, in making the decision, took into consideration the requests made by people of the state for the extension of the curfew time. Despite the relaxation of the curfew, the people of the state have been admonished to ensure compliance with the World Health Organization (WHO), the federal Ministry of Health and state Ministry of Health guidelines on the prevention of Covid-19. They include the use of masks, social distancing, use of hand sanitizer in washing hands and other measures that may be stipulated.
