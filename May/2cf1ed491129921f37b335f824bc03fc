With time, we will meet with Adara, Fulani, Hausa leaders and other stakeholders to work for peace in the area. Reprisal attacks cannot solve the problem and all concerned should desist from it. Both Adara and Fulani have been warned not to take laws into their hands. We made some arrests; I can’t tell the exact numbers but we made arrests over the recent incident in Kajuru community. In no distant time, we will have peace in Kajuru.” he said. Also speaking, the member of House of Representatives representing Chikun/Kajuru Federal constituency, Hon.
