Ibrahim Shuaibu in Kano The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has issued a 14-day ultimatum to the Kano State government to pay back all the deductions it made on workers’ salary in the month May or face strike. A communique issued wednesday by the NLC in Kano said the action of the state government clearly violated the 2019 agreement it had with the congress and demanded that the deductions should be quickly reversed. The communiqué declared the salary deduction for the month of May without the consent of the labour union as illegal because it violated the existing minimum wage law of 2019, which is a product of tripartite committee, entered into and sent to the legislature by the executive body by President Muhammadu Buhari. The NLC also lamented that the government reneged on its promise for the payment of April and November 2019 arrears to workers from the implementation of the consequential adjustment arising from N30, 000 minimum wage as agreed in December, 19, 2019. According to the communiqué, “the state government fails to implement fully, the signed agreement of the consequential adjustment arising from the N30, 000 minimum wage to workers in the local government, Primary Health Care and SUBEB (primary school teachers), tertiary institutions and Ministry of Justice, thereby unilaterally implement partially without the consent of the labour side representing them. “The meeting in session demands the refund of relativity allowances to all entitled and affected members in the State for the month of May 2020 and stop further deduction to respect the agreement reached in May 2018.” The NLC also enjoined the state government to respect all the agreements and pay back the deducted the salary for the month of May from yesterday (Wednesday) to June 15 or face seven-day warning strike.
