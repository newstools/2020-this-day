Chuks Okocha in Abuja The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) wednesday warned against any plot by certain individuals working for the All Progressives Congress (APC) to orchestrate a security situation and push for imposition of a state of emergency in Rivers State. The party said it has been informed of plots by such power-hungry politicians to sponsor their misguided youths to unleash violence and unrest in certain parts of the state to create an impression of security breakdown so as to validate their plot for imposition of emergency rule in the state. The PDP in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, said such anti-people elements included some individuals who were rejected by the people of Rivers State in the 2019 governorship election as well as their godfathers, “who believe they have the backing of power mongers at the federal level, and now seek to manipulate situations with the COVID-19 pandemic to cause confusion and push their plot to take over the governance of the state through the back door.” According to the PDP, “It is clear that the actions of the Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, in protecting the state against the spread of COVID-19 are targeted at nothing but to protect lives, and such have continued to yield very positive results. “Nigerians are also not unaware of the politicisation of the fight against COVID-19 by the agents of the federal government, who appeared uncomfortable with the management of the pandemic by Rivers State Government and other states just because they are controlled by PDP governors.” The main opposition party said it is instructive for those power mongers to note that “this is a time of global pandemic when the country needs its unity. “Our party, therefore, warns those seeking to cause confusion and disaffection to steer clear of Rivers State as they will be firmly resisted. More so, our country is a democratic one, and as such it is guided by rules.” The PDP, however, called on the people of the state to remain calm, alert and united in resisting all attempts by such agents of violence who are seeking to cause trouble in the state.
