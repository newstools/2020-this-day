All muslims across the globe are currently basking in the euphoric mood of Eid – el – Fitr annual festival also known as “the feast of breaking the fast.” The festival marks the end of Ramadan, the ninth month of the Muslim lunar Calendar where every Islamic adherent mandatorily requires to observe fasting according to Quran 2 : 183 ; “Oh you who believe! Fasting is prescribed to you as it was prescribed to those before you that you may become righteous.” This festival transcends the period of merrymaking. It is also a reflection of Ramadan teachings. Unequivocally, Ramadan is aimed at spiritual growth. Every muslim is encouraged to extremely indulge in the acts of worship, supplication, charity and goodness due to huge rewards and blessings which accompanied Ramadan. During this festival, every muslim is encouraged to seek Allah’s blessings and spend time and share food with their family members, friends and neighbours. The financially buoyant ones are also encouraged to render consumable and financial assistance to the poor. Eid – el – Fitr teaches that righteousness, compassion and kindness transcend Ramadan period. Every muslim should always exhibit these traits as prescribed in Quran 2 ; 177 and 195.
