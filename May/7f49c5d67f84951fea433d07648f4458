By Onuminya Innocent The Kebbi State Governor Atiku Bagudu has admonished the Muslim Ummah to sustain the noble lessons learnt in the Holy month of Ramadan to outlive the period. Speaking to the people of the state shortly after the Eid prayers in Birnin Kebbi Sunday, the governor said: “These lessons include patience, perseverance, piety, philanthropy and good neighbourliness. “Our prayers during Ramadan was not in vain. As of now, only five Covid-19 patients remain in the Isolation Centre in Birnin Kebbi.” He expressed happiness with the development, saying: “This shows that, we in Birnin Kebbi are winning the war against the dreaded pandemic. “Noticeable progress is being made in the fight against the disease and our strategies are different. “We must not however relent so long as the problem exists elsewhere.” The governor appealed to the people of the state to sustain the current tempo of invaluable support in the fight against the disease. Bagudu also admonished the people to continue to observe all the measures so far introduced, like social distancing, hand washing, use of masks and hygiene, among others. Doing so, the governor further noted, is part of the long term management of the pandemic. He stated that significant gains had been made under the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari. He said: “We hope that this continues to yield a better, stronger and a more resilient nation.” Bagudu urged the people of the state to take to farming, with a view to allaying the fear that the pandemic would affect food security in Nigeria. He also advised people of the state to continue to remain peaceful and united.
