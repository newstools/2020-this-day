The federal government through the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development will commence the Home-Grown School Feeding Programme of 37589 persons on Thursday, May 21, 2020 in Lagos. The modified programme was flagged off in Kuje, Abuja on May 14, 2020 by the supervising minister, Sadiya Umar Farouq who was joined by Paul Howe, Country Director of the World Food Programme which is providing Technical Support. The special COVID-19 intervention will see 37,589 beneficiaries made up of parents, guardians and care givers of primary 1-3 school children in participating schools receive Take-Home Rations. While the intervention is primarily for school children currently enrolled on the programme, the ministry has also been engaging partners and other agencies to explore options for those children who are not current beneficiaries. Each Take-Home Ration valued at N4,200 is made up of 5 kg Bag of Rice, 5 kg Bag of Beans, 500 ml Vegetable Oil, 750 ml Palm Oil, 500 mg Salt, 15 pcs of eggs, 140gm Tomato Paste. These rations have been reviewed by nutrition experts to ascertain the nutritional value and benefit to the children. Sensitisation, advocacy and enumeration have been ongoing with state aggregators in charge of supplying the materials working round the clock to meet their targets. Commenting on the take-off of the programme in Abuja, the minister said “The turn-out has been impressive in Abuja and it is clear confirmation that Mr. President’s directive for a proactive intervention was a timely one. Covid-19 is taking a health, economic and humanitarian toll on Nigerians and this modified programme is a means of providing relief. It is also boosting the economy by providing income for those in the supply value chain especially poultry farmers.”
