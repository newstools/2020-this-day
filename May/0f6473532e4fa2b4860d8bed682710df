Leicester City will resist offers for Wilfred Ndidi in the upcoming transfer window amid speculation linking the Nigerian midfielder with a departure from the King Power Stadium. In recent weeks, the Super Eagles star had been linked with French champions Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester United, while Arsenal are known to be long-term admirers of the Nath Boys Academy product. It is understood that none of the aforementioned clubs had tabled an official bid for the services of Ndidi. The Nigeria international feels at home at Leicester City and is not thinking about leaving the club even if a bid is made. The 23-year-old inked a new contract after starring at the 2018 World Cup, keeping him at the Foxes until the end of the 2023-2024 season. Since his arrival at Leicester City in January 2017, he has worked his way to become one of the best defensive midfielders in the whole of Europe and his stock could rise further, with Brendan Rodgers side expected to return to Europe next season. It would be recalled that former Nigeria international Daniel Amokachi, recently said Ndidi is bigger than former English Premier League champions Leicester City, believing that it is time for the highly-rated midfielder to change clubs. The 23-year-old Ndidi has established himself as one of the best defensive midfielders in the English Premier League and Amokachi has urged his compatriot to dump the Foxes and move to a bigger club. “I’ve been insisting for a while now that Ndidi is bigger than Leicester City,” Amokachi told Brila FM. “My apologies to the fans of the club, but that is the reality we live in now and it will be a great move for him. Nididi featured in 29 games for Leicester this season, before the campaign was halted due to the coronavirus pandemic since March 2020.
