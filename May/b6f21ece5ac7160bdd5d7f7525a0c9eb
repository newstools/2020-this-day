Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja Nigerian military air strikes hit terrorist locations in the Sambisa Forest area killing scores of insurgents, who were identified as foreign fighters in Borno State. The air interdiction conducted by the Air Task Force of Operation Lafiya Dole also destroyed terrorist logistics facilities at the Alaga Yagayaga in Borno State. The Directorate of Defence Media Operations (DDMO) revealed the breakthrough in a war update yesterday, saying the operation was executed based on credible intelligence reports as well as series of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) missions. The update, which was signed by the Coordinator of the DDMO, Maj.-Gen. John Enenche, said the terrorists had scaled up their activities in the settlement by importing additional fighters and increasing their logistics stocks preparatory to attacks on troops’ locations and surrounding civilian settlements. Based on the intelligence, the update said the ATF dispatched an enhanced force package of attack aircraft and a surveillance platform to engage the location. According to the update, overhead the target area, significant activity of the terrorists was observed in different parts of the settlement. It added that the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) fighter jets “took turns in attacking the target area, neutralizing many BHTs as well as destroying their logistics facilities and other structures in successive passes, thereby further degrading their will to fight.” Enenche said the Armed Forces of Nigeria (AFN), operating in concert with other security agencies and stakeholders would sustain the offensive against the enemies of the country. “We shall not relent until peace and normalcy are restored not only in the North East but also in every other troubled region of our beloved country”, he said.
