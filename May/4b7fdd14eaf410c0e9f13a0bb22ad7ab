Ibrahim Shuaibu in Kano Kano State Governor, Dr. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje last night called for the relaxation of the 14-day total lockdown imposed by the federal government on the state. Ganduje insisted that unlocking the lockdown became pertinent to ease the economic hardship especially in the Holy Month of Ramadan. “We would engage the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 to seek permission to relax the total lockdown imposed on Kano. We are making this appeal on behalf of our people who are presently running out of food items. “We will like the federal government to relax the lockdown for period of time to enable people stock their homes, especially now that majority of us are fasting. It will also ease the economic hardship in the state”. Ganduje spoke at Government House when he inaugurated seven- member experts to support the state task force’s technical committee. He stressed that government is extending facilities to accommodate increasing number of suspected cases. The committee led by the President of National Postgraduate Medical College of Nigeria, Professor Musa Borodo was saddled with the responsibility of developing strategy to support the state taskforce on COVID-19 to end the virus. Meanwhile, the state Coordinator on COVID-19, Dr. Tijani Hussain said death toll of COVID-19 in Kano now stands at five. Tijani added that none of the casualties died in the isolation. The coordinator who put the current positive cases at 135, expressed the hope that some suspected cases who are now certified negative after treatment would soon be discharged.
