Digital learning platform, Clevify, has launched the first virtual classroom app in Africa, just as it unveiled Seyi Awolowo as its brand ambassador. The new app targets to reduce the number of out of school children in the country by offering virtual class alternatives and delivery of imaginative subject-based instructional videos. Chief Operating Officer at Clevify, Deji Maradesa, stated that the app is a support tool for as many students who are struggling to attune themselves to the reality of COVID-19 pandemic. “As an organisation, we are playing our part by providing a platform where students can learn effectively from home. Through our personalised adaptive learning platform, we can reach out to the millions of children staying at home not to lose focus. “Within the four walls of our classroom, you won’t need uniforms or find chairs and tables, or whiteboards, you will find over 10,000 illustrative videos for students in primary to secondary,” he said. On the new brand ambassador, Maradesa explained that Awolowo is the the one who the cap fits, considering his contribution to the growth of education in Africa, as well as alleviation of the poor through the HUWE programme. In his remarks, the BBNaija Season 4 fourth runnerup assured of the effectiveness of the app to support the growth of education in the country. He added, “Clevify app is a fast-paced learning app that is making it possible for students to acquire knowledge at their pace anywhere at any time. The app gives learners unlimited access to exclusive watch-and-learn videos that cut across primary and secondary schools on all android and iOS based devices and it is data-friendly.” Clevify is partnering with NGOs and state governments to enable the app reach every child in Africa.
