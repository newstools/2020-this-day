By Kingsley Nwezeh Fighter jets of the Air Task Force of Operation Lafiya Dole bombed terrorist hideouts and logistic facilities, in Parisu, Borno State, killing scores of insurgents. The air strikes were conducted following intelligence reports that indicated that Boko Haram fighters had resumed the use of the settlements in the Sambisa Forest area from where they plan to launch attack on troops. An update on the war against insurgency issued by the Directorate of Defence Media Operations (DDMO) said the attack aircraft unleashed bombs and rocket fire killing many terrorists. “In furtherance of its objective of restoring peace and security in the North-east of the country, the Armed Forces of Nigeria, through the Air Task Force of Operation Lafiya Dole, yesterday neutralised some Boko Haram terrorists and destroyed some of their logistics facilities at Parisu in the Sambisa Forest area of Borno State. “The air strike, which was executed as a precursor to further air and ground operations, was conducted after intelligence reports revealed that the terrorists had resumed use of the settlement as a staging area to launch attacks against nearby troops’ locations,” it said. The update signed by the Coordinator of DDMO, Major General John Enenche, said aerial surveillance missions had also shown significant terrorist activities in the area whilst identifying some compounds housing the fighters and their logistics items. “Consequently, the Air Task Force dispatched its fighter jets to attack the location. The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) jets, while taking turns to engage the target area, scored accurate bomb and rocket strikes, resulting in the destruction of some of the structures as well as the killing of several terrorists. “The Armed Forces of Nigeria will continue to sustain the offensive against the enemies of the country, until peace and normalcy are restored in all parts of Nigeria,” it said.
