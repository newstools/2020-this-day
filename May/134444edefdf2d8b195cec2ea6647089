A yet-to-be-identified man on Tuesday night broke two gates and forced his way into the compound where a house occupied by the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, was located in his Ile Oodua’s palace in Ile Ife. Several gunshots were also heard around the palace and a suspect was arrested in connection with the incident. It was gathered that a man driving a Mercedes Benz car with two passengers, had driven to the entrance of the palace some minutes to 7p.m but the security men at the entrance denied the vehicle entry and asked the driver to park. “But before they could check the vehicle, two of the passengers had disembarked and ran away, while the driver forced his way in. He hit the first gate and drove straight towards where Ooni lives. “He also succeeded in breaking the second gate and was already near Ooni’s residence. He later disembarked. The man was dressed in a long robe and had a dog with him. “The dog was later shot dead, while the man was apprehended. The man was later taken to Moore Police Station in Ile Ife,” the source said. Repeated attempts to reach the spokesperson for Ooni, Mr. Moses Olafare, were unsuccessful as calls to his mobile line did not connect, while he had not responded to inquiries through text message sent to him as of the time of filing this report.
