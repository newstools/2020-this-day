The name Otunba Subomi Balogun means many things to many people. To some, the name stands for courage and tenacity; to some others, it stands for inventiveness, brilliance, and distinction. Balogun, a colossus in the Nigerian money market, is a man of excellence, integrity. He is also a trailblazer and pioneer extraordinaire. Indeed, the founder of FCMB Group is a philanthropist with a difference. He does his things with the fear of God and huge respect for humanity. The colourful and flamboyant octogenarian, Society Watch gathered, recently proved again that he is never tired of helping others, as he donated relief materials to the people of Ijebu-Ode in Ogun State as part of palliative measures to cushion the effects of the lockdown occasioned by the outbreak of COVID-19. This gesture, as disclosed by a source, is one of his countless interventions since the onset of the deadly coronavirus. The billionaire has donated 750 bags of rice to community leaders in Ijebu-Ode, 150 bags of rice to residents of the Erinlu community in Ijebu Ode, and the Anglican Church, Italowajoda in Ijebu Ode, Ogun State. The latest donation, which was 300 bags of rice, was handed over by Prof. Bankole Okuwa, the curator of Otunba Tunwase Museum, for distribution among the residents of Ijebu Ode.
It is a fact that Balogun’s act of fellow-feeling has been described as legendary, particularly his love for children’s healthcare. Society Watch gathered that he had donated more facilities to that sector more than any known Nigerian. Lately, he built and donated the 40-bed children hospital, known as Iye Subomi Child Care Centre at the Ijebu-Ode General Hospital. He also built the Otunba Tunwase Children’s Emergency Ward at the University College Hospital, Ibadan, and the widely reported N3.7 billion Otunba Tunwase National Paediatric Centre (OTNPC) at Ijebu-Ode in Ogun State.
