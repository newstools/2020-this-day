Mary Nnah BASF West Africa has supported the government of Lagos State in the fight against the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) by donating one thousand (1,000) protective face shields for health workers in the isolation centre in Lagos State. According to a statement released by the company, the demand for certain medical devices, including personal protective equipment (PPE), during this COVID-19 pandemic, has exceeded the available supply worldwide. To bridge this gap, BASF explored the option of the production of medical face shields via its expertise in 3D printing. These face shields are being distributed in the countries and communities in which the company operates, including Nigeria. The medical face shields will help frontline health care workers in Lagos state protect themselves as they provide care to COVID-19 patients. Managing Director and Country Cluster Head for BASF West Africa, Jean-Marc Ricca, stated that in addition to these donations, and in line with BASF’s principles on sustainability and value to society, BASF West Africa would also contribute to societal empowerment by supporting the local production of top range face masks, having identified small scale technology startup companies with competence to produce these masks. “Leveraging on our global expertise, we will support these companies by exposing them to best practices, latest technology and access to market”, he said. He appreciated the efforts of Nigeria‘s medical team who are in the frontline, doing their best against COVID-19 and reiterated that BASF West Africa is working tirelessly towards supporting her customers during the lockdown period by ensuring continuous supply of raw materials for the manufacturing of food and other essential items.
