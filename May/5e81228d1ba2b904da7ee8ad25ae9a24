By Martins Ifijeh The Republic of Lebanon has said 25 of its citizens evacuated from Kano State on Tuesday have tested positive for COVID-19. This was contained in a statement by the country’s Ministry of Public Health published on its website Wednesday after it took delivery of the evacuees from Nigeria. The republic had last month asked Middle East Airlines to evacuate its citizens from foreign countries, including Nigeria, following the rise in COVID-19 pandemic across the world. According to Lebanon’s Ministry of Public Health, the 25 affected passengers will be taken to hospital for treatment, while others who tested negative would be quarantined. It said: “Accordingly, the affected cases will be transferred to the hospital with an emphasis on the application of strict domestic quarantine for negative cases, knowing that they will be followed up daily by the ministry and whoever shows any symptoms will be referred to the hospital for re-examination.”
