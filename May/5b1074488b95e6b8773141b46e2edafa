By Igbawase Ukumba The Nigeria Air Force (NAF) on Sunday deployed Special Forces in Nasarawa State to tackle insecurity in the North-central zone. The state Governor, Abdullahi Sule, received the troops at the Lafia Cargo Airport and commended President Muhammadu Buhari for his prompt response to tackle insecurity in the zone. Sule expressed satisfaction that the response came just three days after he called for help from the federal government, assuring the troops that the state would support them to ensure that all forms of crime are eliminated in the state. Addressing the troops at the Lafia Airport, the Chief of Air Staff (CAS), Sadique Abubakar, urged them to be professional in their conduct. “I urge you to be professional and uphold the core NAF values of integrity, service before self and excellence in all you do,” he said. Abubakar, who was represented by AVM Charles Ohwo, the Air Officer Commanding Special Operations Command, told the Special Forces that they were deployed to complement and add value to the already existing security apparatus on ground. “You must cooperate with Operation Whirl Stroke. Your deployment is not only for Lafia, but for the North-central,” he said. The air chief appreciated the Nasarawa State Government for the provision of facility for the establishment of the 22 Quick Response Wing in Lafia. The troops were deployed to tackle the emerging security challenges, such as banditry, cattle rustling and farmers/herders clash in the zone.
