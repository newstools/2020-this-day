They invaded the community at about 1am on Tuesday and started killing people. “Twelve of the people were killed on the spot, the corpses of five others were recovered in the bush. There are those who sustained injuries. “Some were killed with machete, some were killed by gunshots. Some houses were burnt. Some of those who escaped to the bush are still missing. “About two hours after the bandits fled, the security personnel manning a checkpoint not too far from the community came.
