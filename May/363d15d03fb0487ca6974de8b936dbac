By Francis Sardauna The management of BUA Foundation has donated three ambulances to the Katsina State Government as part of its contribution in curtailing the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic in the state. The Chairman of the Foundation, Alhaji AbdulSamad Rabi’u, while presenting the Covid-19 response ambulances on Thursday, said the gesture was aimed at supporting government’s efforts in tackling the disease. BUA Foundation is the philanthropic arm of Africa’s leading foods and infrastructure conglomerate, BUA Group, founded by Rabi’u. The chairman, represented by Abdullahi Malumfashi, added that the foundation had expended eight billion in rendering such humanitarian assistance across the country. He said: “So far, the foundation has spent over eight billion in such assistance through palliatives, medical equipment, building, beds and other things that the foundation feels can assist in tackling this menace. This we feel government cannot do it alone, people must come in.” Speaking shortly after receiving the ambulances, Governor Aminu Bello Masari said the state government was building 722-capacity bed isolation centres across the state. The governor requested the foundation to assist the state government with hospital beds in order to equip its isolation centres. He said: “We are very grateful but we request that we want hospital beds. We are building 722-bed capacity isolation centres in the state. “We have furnished one completely and admission has started. Rehabilitation and reconstruction of two others is in progress. Certainly, we need assistance in the area of beds and beddings.”
