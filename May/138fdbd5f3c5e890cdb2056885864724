Qatar Airways has announced that it would give 100,000 free tickets to frontline healthcare professionals to thank them for their heroic service of taking care of people during the current COVID-19 pandemic. The airline said by maintaining 24/7 operations in recent months, including the provision of over 100 charter flights, Qatar Airways’ mission to repatriate over one million people has received widespread praise and thanks from passengers and governments as the foremost airline taking people home. Given the airline’s work at the frontline of global efforts to repatriate stranded passengers, it now seeks to recognise and reward the world’s frontline healthcare workers. Qatar Airways said the healthcare professionals from every country in the world would be eligible for tickets.
It explained that to ensure the application process is fair and transparent, each country would receive a daily allocation of tickets, depending on its population size, staggered over a seven-day period from 12th to 18th May. The daily allocation would be released at 00:01 AM Doha time throughout the campaign period. “Healthcare professionals that receive the promotion code can book up to two complimentary Economy Class return tickets on Qatar Airways operated flights – one for themselves and one for a companion – to anywhere on the airline’s global network. “Tickets must be booked before 26 November, with travel valid until 10 December 2020. The tickets will be fully flexible, with an unlimited number of destination or date changes allowed without any fees. Fare and surcharges will be waived on tickets, airport taxes apply,” the airline said.
