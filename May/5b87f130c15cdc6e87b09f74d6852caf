Bulgaria’s Kubrat Pulev, the mandatory challenger to the IBF heavyweight title that Anthony Joshua is holding has accused the British-Nigerian of being scared of him. The IBF title is one of the four heavyweight titles that Joshua is holding. Fellow Briton, Tyson Fury, holds the fifth heavyweight title organized by WBC. Joshua was originally given a 20 June date to mandatorily defend his IBF title against Pulev, but the fight has been called off owing to the coronavirus pandemic. But UK’s The Sun has reported that there have been rumours that Joshua and his Matchroom tean are hoping Pulev steps aside so their man can face Fury in an undisputed heavyweight clash. But Pulev is adamant he is going no where and he is furious that a date has not been set in stone for the title fight. Speaking about the idea of letting Fury in, the 39-year-old said: “I wouldn’t accept it. “I did it once when I didn’t have to do it for him (Joshua) to have his second match against Ruiz Jr. “Everything was against IBF’s rules, but I compromised. “I see how people are afraid of me and are trying to face someone else before me. “Thats not how a real world champion should act. “Even Mike Tyson and Evander Holyfield are coming back to the game to show that they are real warriors, not like him.” Joshua, 30, defeated Andy Ruiz Jr in a December rematch in Saudi Arabiato win back his IBF, WBA, WBO and IBO titles. Six months earlier he had lost them when the Mexican delivered one of boxing’s biggest ever shocks with a seventh-round KO win. Now Pulev is ready to spring his own surprise – and he wants to get the date and venue sorted. He added: “Enough is enough. “I cant understand why we are still postponing instead of fixing a date and venue and getting to work? I cant wait to win this fight. “A year has passed, and they always have a reason to postpone, not to fight against me.
