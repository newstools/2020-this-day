Sylvester Idowu in Warri A group under the auspices of Creek Dragons (CD) has appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to reappoint the current Executive Director of the Nigerian Content Development Monitoring Board (NCDMB), Engr. Simbi Wabote. The group prevailed on the President and the Minister for Petroleum, State, Chief Timpre Sylva to disregard the call by another group not to reappoint Wabote. CD, in a statement and signed by its President General, Freedom Adowei maintained that the Ijaws and indeed Nigerians were comfortable and proud of the leadership of the current executive secretary of NCDMB describing its leadership as impeccable and result oriented. The group warned some ex-militant leaders not to hide under the umbrella of MEND to front their personal interests, stressing that they should be bold enough to use their names to confront and chastise their interests. “Engr. Simbi Wabote, Executive Secretary of the Nigerian Content Development Monitoring Board is not found wanting in any way, he should be reappointed to continue his good works for the board and the Ijaw nation as well. “Anyone calling for his non reappointment is an enemy of Ijaw nation, we are therefore urging our dynamic minister for Petroleum, State, Chief Timpre Sylva to completely disregard such unproductive and fake calls crying for the downfall of fellow Ijaw man against the larger interest of Ijaw nation. “Engr. Simbi has done more than enough to deserve whatever appointment in that board and beyond”, it stated.
