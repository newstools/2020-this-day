The Governor of Imo State, Senator Hope Uzodinma, has inaugurated a 100-bed Isolation Centre at Imo State University Teaching Hospital (IMSUTH), Orlu. The isolation centre, donated by Access Bank Plc and described as first class by the governor would take care of all COVID-19 cases and other diseases that may be traced in the state. Addressing people during the ceremony, the governor said Imo State was lucky, unlike other states, not to have recorded any casualty from COVID-19. He thanked Access Bank Plc for their gesture and advised Imolites to continue to observe the pandemic protocols of hand washing, use of sanitisers, face masks and social distancing as a way of staying safe from the pandemic. The governor seized the opportunity to explain to IMSUTH personnel why their salary had not been paid, promising that as soon as the authorities do what was expected of them, the salary would be credited to their accounts electronically. Earlier, the Commissioner for Health, Dr. Damaris Osunkwo thanked the governor for giving the ministry the needed support to ensure that Imo was free from COVID-19 pandemic. She further said for effective service delivery, the ministry had been able to train 270 health workers at the state level, 2,204 at the local government level, and 4860 community mobilisers who were in the field sensitising people. Imo State Chairman of COVID-19 Task Force, Prof. Maurice Iwu, said that the centre was the best as all the facilities therein were brand new and not refurbished. He thanked Governor Uzodinma for giving Imo State the best of protections through his approach to the curbing of the disease.
