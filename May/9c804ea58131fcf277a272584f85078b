World football governing body FIFA has confirmed it is investigating a claim from Sampdoria against Sporting Lisbon in relation to the “financial obligationsset out in the contract corresponding to the transfer” of Bruno Fernandesto Manchester United. A FIFA spokesperson confirmed a complaint was lodged by Sampdoria on April 3 relating to the deal which took Fernandes from Sporting to United in the January transfer window. According to the spokesperson: “The matter is currently being investigated and consequentlywe cannot provide further comments.” It has been reported that Sampdoria believe they are entitled to 10 per cent of any profit Sporting made on Fernandes, who was sold to United for 58m Euros (£47m) in January. That would mean Sampdoria, where Fernandes played for one season before joining Sporting Lisbon for £7.5m in 2017, would be entitled to a payment of around £4m. Since joining United, Fernandes has been impressive for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side. The 25-year-old has made five Premier League appearances, scored two goals and has three assists. He was voted Premier League’s Player of the Month for February, which was his third individualprize since his transfer to United in January. His other two individual awards are United’s fans Player of the Month award and the PFA award.
