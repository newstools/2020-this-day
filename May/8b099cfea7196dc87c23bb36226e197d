Our total assets grew by 1.3 per cent to N30.7 billion from N30.4 billion in 2018. Our shareholders’ funds stood at 18.5 billion for the period from N17.1 billion in 2018.” Adekoya, described 2019 as a challenging year for the company because of the marginal growth in GWP, adding that the disciplined execution of the company’s transformation projects and growth strategies were expected to start yielding the desired results this year.
