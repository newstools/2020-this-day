The family unit is strategic in the development process and in curbing the spread of Covid-19 in the society among other aspects of societal welfare. The wife of the Governor of Ogun state, Mrs. Bamidele Abiodun, said this in her message to commemorate this year’s International Day of Families, that was celebrated recently. The day is globally set aside by the United Nations to provide an opportunity to promote awareness of issues relating to families and to increase the knowledge of the social, economic and demographic processes affecting families. Abiodun, in a statement that was signed by the Press Officer, Office of the First Lady of Ogun State, Kemi Oyeleye, enjoined fathers, mothers as well as children in the families to be united and be more supportive particularly during this period in order to overcome the Covid-19 pandemic. According to her, the family unit has the responsibility of looking out and caring for one another in crisis which she said was key to the focus of the UN on investing in social policies, protecting the most vulnerable families and individuals. She reaffirmed her commitment towards alleviating the socio economic status of women in the state as key components of families, emphasising that the distribution of palliatives during the lockdown was a demonstration of the administration’s commitment to the people’s welfare. The First Lady urged family members to encourage and protect one another at this period by observing physical and social distancing, personal hygiene and living responsibly.
