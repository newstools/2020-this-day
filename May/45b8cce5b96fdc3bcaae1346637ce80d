By Vanessa Obioha The 10-day online global film festival ‘We Are One: A Global Film Festival’ organised by Tribeca Film Festival and YouTube will officially begin Friday (today) on YouTube. The festival which is a solidarity move by major film festivals across the world such as Cannes Film Festival, Venice International Film Festival, BFI London Film Festival, Berlin International Film Festival among others will feature documentaries, feature films, shorts, music, comedy and conversations. The digital programming of the selected films is an effort by the organisers to unite curators, artists and storytellers to entertain and provide relief to audiences worldwide. The festival will also help to raise funds for the World Health Organization (WHO)’s Covid-19 Solidarity Response Fund and beyond. Some of the films selected for streaming include the award-winning Virtual Reality (VR) documentary, ‘Daughters of Chibok’ by Nigerian filmmaker Joel Benson. The lined-up films for the first day of streaming include ‘The Distance Between the Sky and Us’ (Cannes); ‘Rudeboy: The Story of Trojan Records’ (BFI); ‘Egg’ (Tribeca), ‘Electric Swan’ (Venice); ‘Cinema Cafe with Jackie Chan’ (Sundance); and ‘Crazy World’ (TIFF).
