By Michael Olugbode The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) has distributed food items to 38,000 households in internally displaced persons (IDPs) camps in Borno State. The distribution is part of efforts to make the displaced persons comfortable throughout the Ramadan season and the hardship that may be brought to bear as a result of the lockdown to battle the Covid-19 pandemic. A statement on Thursday by the spokesman of the North-east zonal office of NEMA, AbdulKadir Ibrahim, said: “In continuation of efforts to provide succour and in line with the agenda of the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Hajia Sadiya Farouk, on welfare of Internally Displaced Persons, National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) has distributed food items to 38,000 households of internally displaced persons in Borno State following an approval granted by the Director General, NEMA, AVM Muhammed Alhaji Muhammed (rtd).” Ibrahim said the Head of NEMA food distribution in charge of Borno, Flt. Lt. Umar Sani, led the distribution to some of the IDP camps in Borno State including Muna Garage IDP camp and Bakassi IDP camp. He listed the items distributed to include rice, beans, maize, tomato paste, seasoning, salt and cooking oil. Ibrahim said the items were distributed through NEMA to address the needs of internally displaced persons affected by the Boko Haram insurgency. He noted that NEMA is providing food assistance to over 234,000 displaced persons monthly who are residing in IDP camps, host communities and liberated communities in Borno State. He disclosed that the present round of distribution started at Bakassi IDP camp on May 7, 2020 and is expected to move to all IDP camps in the troubled state before the Ramadan season is over.
