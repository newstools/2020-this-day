His recent single has a blend of multicultural Afrobeat sound and is gaining traction on social media. The Nigerian musician called Oluwatosin Alabi, popularly known as ‘705’, which was coined out of the first three letters of his abbreviated name Tosin to form ‘TOS’ and switched backwards, to form the letters ‘705’ by replacing alphabets with numerical figures, has been in the music industry for quite some time. He is related to Afrobeat sensation and star musician, Naira Marley. According to his social media posts, they both lived together between 2010 and 2012 focusing on music but had to part ways when he (705) got married and started having kids, while Naira Marley went on to be the global sensation he is today. ‘705’ started singing from an early age of six when he began to show interest in music and his favourite artist growing up was King Sunny Ade. According to him, music took him away from the dramas of life, which happened to be his way of life as well as therapy for his mind. He has some notable stagecraft appeal and performed at the Afrobeat to the world concert in Manchester 02 Indigo on June 15, 2019, performing his smash single “Money”, which featured Djonez while opening the stage for the likes of Teni, Mafikizolo and others.
