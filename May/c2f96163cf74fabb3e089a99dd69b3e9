Eight doctors have tested positive for coronavirus in Zamfara State, according to the Vice Chairman of the Nigeria Medical Association (NMA), Zamfara branch, Dr. Mannir Bature, in Gusau yesterday. Bature said, “Out of about 80 confirmed cases recorded so far in the state, 10 per cent are doctors who came into contact with the virus in the line of duty while trying to save lives, especially during emergencies.” He, however, explained that some of the doctors have been discharged from the hospital while others are responding to treatment. Bature said 30 other doctors, who came into contact with their infected colleagues, are in isolation to curb further spread of the virus in the state. According to him, the situation has caused a negative impact on the performance of doctors in the state, especially during the pandemic. “We only have a total of about 300 doctors in the state, including those at the Federal Medical Centre, Gusau as well as other state government’s health facilities,” he added. Bature, therefore, called on the state government to consider the employment of more doctors to combat the pandemic.
