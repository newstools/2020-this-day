Peter Uzoho The BudgIT Foundation has called on the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and the Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Commission (ICPC) to investigate series of reports directly implicating the Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Hon. Mudashiru Obasa, over misappropriation of public funds. The foundation said that Obasa has been accused of financial impropriety and misappropriation of N257 million, N17 million and N53 million while the latest of the same allegation being the receipt of N80 million estacode by himself, his deputy and 17 others for attending a five-day event in Dubai amidst the fight against COVID-19. BudgIT in a statement yesterday signed by its Communications Director, Damilola Ogundipe, said the allegation corroborated its claim that the legislative arm of government had been largely non-responsive to the calls for transparency and accountability both at the federal and state levels, and that these present allegations deepened the culture of disregard for transparency in the management of public funds. Ogundipe said: “it is disheartening that lawmakers, both at the national and state levels, are not being held to the highest standards of scrutiny. “It has become imperative to emphasise the need for both the national and state houses of assembly to be above board by entrenching a framework for fiscal transparency and accountability.” BudgIT, however, called on the ICPC and EFCC to be proactive in investigating the foregoing allegations, to
show their seriousness in fighting corruption in the country, as well as to elevate public confidence in the government.
