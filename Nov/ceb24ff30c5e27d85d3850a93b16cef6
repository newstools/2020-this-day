We request an end to the ongoing strike by ASUU. The struggle of “ASUU should never be undermined as we all truly know a revitalisation and improvement in the quality of infrastructure and regulation of payment of salaries is needed. “Ending ASUU strike by giving utmost consideration to our demands is key and a way to kick-start. Do this and secure the future of our beloved nation. In view of the above, we hereby give the federal government an ultimatum of seven days to resolve the crisis and get us back to school; else, there would be aggressive nationwide agitations thereafter. “We are going to use legal means for our agitation and others that are within the legal framework of the nation. All means of agitations will be used. Protest is one of the means”. On his part, the President, University of Ilorin Students’ Union, Wisdom Okoko, said: “ASUU strike is killing us. We won’t fold our hands and allow them to ruin our lives and future. The Federal Government and ASUU are putting their interests forward. Nobody is putting the interest of the students as a priority. We have come to put the interest of our students as a priority. “We can’t continue to keep quiet. ASUU and government are taking us for a ride. ASUU is fighting for its interest. The earlier they respond to our demand, the better for us.”
