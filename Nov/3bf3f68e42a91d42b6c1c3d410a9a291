By Adedayo Akinwale The Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has dissolved the Ebonyi State Working Committee of the party. The Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the party, Mr. Yekini Nabena, in a statement issued Wednesday said the dissolution of the state executive was due to the refusal of factions to withdraw court cases as directed by the 8th resumed meeting of the APC National Executive Committee (NEC) and submit to internal party resolution mechanisms initiated by the caretaker committee. However, the dissolution of the party’s executive in the state may not be unconnected with the recent defection of the state Governor, David Umahi, to the ruling party from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Nabena said, “A 15-member caretaker committee has subsequently been appointed by the APC caretaker committee to manage the party’s affairs and carry out the planned membership registration, update, and revalidation exercise in Ebonyi State.” Members of the Ebonyi APC Caretaker Commitee are: Mr. Stanley Okoro as Chairman, Mr. John Nwankata as Vice Chairman (North), Mr. Peter Nworie Ndubuisi, as Vice Chairman (Central), Mr. Ozoemena Njoku, as Vice Chairman (South), Mr. Charles Ofoke, as Secretary, Mr. Ogbonnaya Igbok, as Organising Secretary. Others are: Mr. Chidi Ogbuatu, as Publicity Secretary, Mr. Ikaa Ukeni, as Legal Adviser, Mr. Paulinus Ali, as Treasurer, Mr. Joseph Ozibo, as Financial Secretary, Mr. Ogochukwu Elem, as Youth Leader, Ms. Odo Juliet, as Women Leader, Mr. Ogbonna David Nshii, as Auditor, Adum Uchenna Basil, as Leader, Physically Challenge, and Mr. Francis Nweze, as Welfare Secretary. Nabena stressed that as the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led comittee repositions the party, supporters, members and leaders in Ebonyi state and other chapters are urged to support and work towards the achievement of the peace and reconciliation mandate of the committee.
