 In furtherance  of its role of nurturing  young tennis  players from the grassroots, the Federal Ministry  of Youth  and Sports Development (FMY&SD) is to partner United States- based AJ Tennis Academy to establish a world- class tennis academy  in  Abuja. Speaking during a visit to the Sports Minister,  Mr. Sunday Dare  in his office, Director of A J Tennis Academy International based in Minneapolis,  Tolu  Olaleye, said he was excited  by the prospect of partnering the FMY&SD  to develop the next generation  of tennis  players  as well as good citizens. “Our plan is to develop  the tennis  academy  as a business in partnership with domestic  and foreign investors  to ensure long- term  survival and serve as a model for other sports. “We are here to explore  ways of  gaining support for this initiative  from the Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development,” observed Olaleye. In his response, the Sports Minister Dare said: “Thanks for your faith in Nigeria. The timing of this initiative is very good  and in consonance with our new sports industry policy which classifies  sports as business. “It also falls within the  purview  of our ‘Adopt-a-Sport initiative’.  I fully support this initiative and  will give whatever support needed to make it succeed,” stressed the minister. Dare further advised the initiator to consider replicating the Academy in Ibadan, Lagos and Abeokuta to derive maximum benefits. The  pilot project  is to be sited in Abuja for which an expanse  of land has been allocated by the Federal Capital Development Authority.
