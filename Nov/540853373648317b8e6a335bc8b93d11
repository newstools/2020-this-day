By Udora Orizu The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has threatened to drag the National Assembly and the Northern Governors Forum to court if they pass the social media bill and it’s eventually signed by the President Muhammadu Buhari. SERAP made this known in a tweet posted on its verified Twitter handle on Tuesday, while reacting to a proposal by the northern governors for more social media regulations in the wake of the #EndSARS protests. The tweet reads: ”We’ll sue the Northern Governors’ Forum and the National Assembly if any social media bill is passed and signed by President Buhari. Nigerians have a right to freedom of expression online. We won’t accept any illegal attempts to interfere with that right #NoToSocialMediaBill.”
