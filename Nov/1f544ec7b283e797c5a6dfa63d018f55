In the numerous articles about the US election there was one recent item that seems disturbing – gun stores are running out of ammunition. This could be good news as those unhappy with whatever the outcome is won’t be able to buy any ammunition although it also could be disturbing in that they have already bought this ammunition in case of a result they don’t support. For a country that is the land of the free there should be no use of weaponry in the decision or acceptance of an election result. Vote and then accept the result without using lawyers or guns to try and get the result you wanted. Please, there have been enough deaths already in America recently. The same ideal should also apply in all countries as the use of violence seems worldwide. Dennis Fitzgerald,
