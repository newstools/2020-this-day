Rebecca Ejifoma Retired Inspector General of Police, Tafa Balogun, has appealed to police officers across the nation to return to their duty posts. The ex-IG made this appeal after police officers were displaced from their stations during the EndSARS protests. “I urge all members of the Nigeria Police in our country to return to their duty posts and continue to provide the much needed security to our dear country, Nigeria,” Balogun pleaded in a media release issued on Thursday. He said the Nigeria Police remains the first line of Internal Security as guaranteed by the Nigerian Constitution. “Therefore, it behoves all and sundry not to betray the spirit of the Constitution”, adds Balogun. He urged, “all my brothers and sisters in the Police Force to put the past behind us. “The Federal and State Governments, as well as the police authorities are positively and aggressively addressing the unprecedented provocative attacks on the police institution. We all love you.” He, therefore, enjoined all officers to return to duty without further delay.
