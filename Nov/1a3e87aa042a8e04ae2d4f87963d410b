The last time either of the two giants of Spanish football, Barcelona and Real Madrid, were not leading after Week 9 was in 2006, when Sevilla topped the table.
Looking at the current La Liga table, Real Sociedad, Villarreal and Atlético Madrid occupy first, second and third places respectively. Real Madrid are fourth – four points behind Real Sociedad, albeit with a game in hand, while Barcelona are eighth – nine points behind the leaders, but having played two games less.

Atlético and Barça will be a special one for Uruguay striker Luis Suárez, who was told by Koeman at the start of the season, that he could find a new club. The striker joined Atlético and has not looked back, telling Spanish journalists: “I felt sad and hurt by the way I left Barcelona, but now I feel proud. When I was not wanted, I found somewhere I was. I’ve found happiness.” No doubt he will be even happier if he can help his new team-mates to a victory against his former team-mates.
