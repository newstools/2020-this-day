Donald Trump is talking of claiming a victory if the early numbers go his way. I like this approach as my football team led at the end on the first quarter – victory assured, although later quarters were less positive. I had the first two numbers of the Lotto – time to spend the money, although not all subsequent numbers matched mine. My racehorse was leading as it entered the straight – time to collect the cup, even though a few sprinted past soon after. I look for the positive in life too but I’m not claiming victory till someone else, who is credible, confirms it. Aim for a win, hope for a win, although be ready to congratulate the winner if it is someone else. Dennis Fitzgerald,
