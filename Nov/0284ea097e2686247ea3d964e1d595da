Smile and Shine Children’s Foundation – a non-profit organization for children, aimed at preventing child sexual abuse, providing the needed help and support as well as emergency care and treatment with adequate follow up and rehabilitation for victims (children) of sexual abuse. The goal and drive towards this heart of kindness is the brainchild of Dr. Nimi Ekere, a trained medical doctor and a consultant Family Physician who is extremely passionate about children and young people walking in the right path to achieve their full potentials. Speaking to Dr Nimi on why she started the foundation she shares, “Smile and Shine Children’s Foundation started because I have a longing to end child sexual abuse. I had seen children become medically and psychologically traumatized because of CSA, while some even committed suicide. I have seen parents lose their children to the fallouts of CSA. I have also seen people condemn the victims or survivors rather than give them the support that they deserve while the perpetrators walk the streets like heroes; I want to stop this.” The official opening of the Foundation tagged: Combating the Rising Scourge Of Child Sexual Abuse is set to be graced by eminent personalities in governance, business and religion including Lagos State Commissioner for Education Mrs. Folasade Adefisayo, Access Bank MD, Herbert Wigwe, Former DG of NIMASA Dr. Dakuku Adol-Peterside, Pastor Ituah Ighodalo and many more who will take turns to speak on various topics. In conclusion, she mentioned, “I want to be able to help children not to get abused in the first place and the sad event that they get abused, that help is proffered and these children are subsequently reintegrated back into the society and become healthy adults regardless. I want to also break the silence that is attached to CSA.”
