Speaking more about the show, Nevada Bridge CEO, Neville Sajere said: “The uniqueness about your hood, the experiences you’ve had while growing up in that hood and also those nostalgic feeling and memories going back to the hood brings, are they things you can share to be a representative of that particular hood, such that when you speak in a particular language, not everyone understands but a particular demography. It shows that there is a unique sect that shares similar lingua and you are their rep in the hood because they would easily relate to anything you say or do in the house.” The of the show producers have released a theme song, with two music powerhouse, Sound Sultan and 2 baba serving great tune and exciting lyrics. t
