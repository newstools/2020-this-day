The Emir of Bichi, Dr. Nasiru Ado Bayero, has stressed the need for the country’s unity and expressed gratitude to the Government of Enugu State for the peace the Northern community has been enjoying in the state. Speaking when Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi played host to him at the Government House, Enugu, the Emir commended the state government’s commitment to national integration and peaceful co-existence of all Nigerians living in the state, irrespective of tribe, religion and political differences. The monarch also appreciated the traditional rulers in Enugu State, stressing that based on “your relationship with the Northern community in your own local communities, our reports from them have been positive; so we are very grateful”. He used the opportunity to assure the governor that “back in Kano State, we will protect your interest; we will make sure that any Igbo man or any other Nigerian who lives Kano is safe. He maintained that “our relationship has grown beyond now and we will not allow this to grow any bad situation”. The Emir therefore lauded the state for its hospitality and also commended the governor for what he described as his uncommon leadership style anchored on peace, security, and good governance. Describing his visit to Enugu State as a homecoming, he narrated the enduring relationship his late father, Ado Bayero, enjoyed with his Igbo friends, especially when he was the Chancellor of the University of Nigeria Nsukka (UNN) for over 20 years. He disclosed that his visit to the state was “to build that bridge between the Northern Nigeria and this part of Nigeria, the East”, stressing: “We shall continue to build that bridge; we shall continue to make sure that Nigeria remains one and despite all of these, we shall remain brothers by the grace of God”.
