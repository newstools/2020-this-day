With the way things have been happening all over, Nigerians are in dire need of just one positive story no matter how minute. That is why we have been seeing so many proclamations of our mummy and aunty as the new director general of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). The fact that most of us do not even know what they do in that place or where it is stationed for all it matters has not stopped us from fighting for her presidency. We still need something to latch on in this dour and sad period. With Nigeria and Nigerians at our lowest ebb in national cohesion, this positive news will go a long way to give us a tiny glimmer of hope. The fact that the US is still not standing with her on this and also that she now carries an American citizenship has not stopped or even reduced the patriotic zeal. We just want something to hold on to. She will emerge, she has to, if for nothing else we need the PR fix. God will make it happen. Oya prayers!
