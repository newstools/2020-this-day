Former Nigeria international Yakubu Aiyegbeni has labeled Gernot Rohr as one of the ‘worst coaches’ in Super Eagles history and questioned some of the credentials of the current crop of players. In the recent Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifiers, Nigeria squandered a four-goal lead in a 4-4 draw at home to Sierra Leone before playing to a 0-0 stalemate in the reverse fixture away to the Leone Stars in Freetown.
Nigeria remain top of Group L despite the results and remain on the cusp of qualification for Cameroon 2022, but Aiyegbeni believes Rohr is unfit for the hot-seat and has demanded he relinquish his post. “The coach is not good enough, let him go,” said Aiyegbeni on Lagos Talks as reported by Goal.com.
“Some of the boys are not good enough, I don’t know where they are bringing them from. Who is inviting these players?
The former Blackburn Rovers, Everton, Middlesbrough, Leicester City and Portsmouth forward added: “Our football is getting worse every day. When I was there, people criticised us, but we’re way better than these ones. “The coach is not good enough, no clue. Gernot Rohr is one of the worst coaches in our history. He is not good enough.”
Rohr, 67, took over the Nigerian reins in 2016 and led the club to 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification and a third-place finish at the 2019 Afcon hosted in Egypt.
