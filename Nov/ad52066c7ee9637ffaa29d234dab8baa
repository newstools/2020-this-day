Chivita 100% Fruit Juice has announced that it won the 2020 Marketing Edge Outstanding Juice Brand Award. This year’s award made it the fourth time in five years that Chivita 100% is coming top in this category and thereby reaffirms its dominance in the fruit juice market. The award was seen as a deserved recognition for the brand’s category leadership which it has earned through superior product quality, consistent innovation, advocacy, as well as engagement approach aimed at deepening conversations on the role of 100% fruit juice in everyday wellness. Renowned for its quality nourishment, Chivita 100% is a great tasting 100% fruit juice made from real natural fruits with no added sugar, no artificial colours and no preservatives. According to the award organisers, the nomination and subsequent emergence of Chivita 100% as the ‘Outstanding Juice Brand of the Year’ was a product of painstaking review and assessment of the Juice segment of the Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) sector of the Nigerian economy. “It is on record that Chivita 100% has since its entry into the market dominated the Juice segment with variants that are individually iconic brands. It has also brought so much innovation to product development, packaging, branding and advocacy. This development has literally shot it to the peak of the pack in its product segment and sustained it there,” they stated. Responding on behalf of CHI Limited, Brand Manager, Chivita, Ademola Mafikuyomi, stated that the Marketing Edge Most Outstanding Juice Brand of the Year award for Chivita 100% is the latest in a long line of awards for the brand. “We are delighted to receive this recognition for the superior quality and innovation of Chivita 100%. The award further encourages us in our drive as the market leader in the fruit juice category to champion the 100% fruit juice consumption narrative in Nigeria,” he said.
