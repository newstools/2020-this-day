By Victor Ogunje The newly upgraded Ekiti State University of Education, Science and Technology, Ikere Ekiti, was yesterday named after the late Governor of the old Ondo State, Evangelist Bamidele Olumilua. Consequently, the new institution is now to be known as Bamidele Olumilua University of Education, Science and Technology (BOUEST). Olumilua, who was the governor of the old Ondo State between 1992 and 1993, died early this year at the age of 80. During the debate on the floor of the state House of Assembly, the lawmaker from Ikole (11) constituency, Steven Aribasoye, moved a motion for the renaming at a special sitting presided over by the Speaker, Funminiyi Afuye. The bill for the renaming of the University of Education after Olumilua was equally sponsored by Aribasoye, and supported by most members via voice vote. The state Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, had on October 17, 2020, signed into law the bill backing the upgrading of the College of Education Ikere Ekiti to the University of Education, Science and Technology, as part of activities making the second anniversary of his administration. The College of Education Ikere- Ekiti (formerly Ondo State College of Education) was established by an Edict on December 5, 1977. The governor explained that the signing into law of the legislation that backed the upgrading of the college to university was in realisation of his administration commitment to promoting knowledge and economy in the state, assuring the people that his administration would continue to demonstrate commitment to the promotion of knowledge in the state.
