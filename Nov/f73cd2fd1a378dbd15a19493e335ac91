Ikeja Electric (IE) has notified its customers of the implementation of its revised Service Reflective Tariff (SRT) with effect from November 1, 2020 as approved by the regulator. In a statement by its Head, Corporate Communications, Mr. Felix Ofulue, IE said the revision is as a result of the consultative review meetings held between the federal government, labour unions and other stakeholders, following concerns raised about the basis of the MYTO 2020 SRT tariffs, which were earlier planned to be implemented from September 1, 2020. It said under the SRT, the tariff classification is based on the quality of service and therefore, divided into five bands (A-E); measured by the average availability of power supply over a month, interruptions (frequency and duration), voltage levels and other service parameters. With the revised tariff regime, Ofulue said, non-MD customers in Band A, with a minimum of 20 hours daily, will now pay N51.22/Kwh; Band B customers with minimum of 16 hours daily, will be charged N46.93/Kwh; while Band C customers with a minimum of 12 hours daily will be charged N37.95/Kwh. IE stated that customers in Bands D and E with a minimum of eight hours and four hours per day respectively, are not impacted by the tariff revision, adding that their SRT tariffs have been frozen and consequently, they will continue to be charged the old tariff prior to the introduction of the SRT. According to electricity distribution firm, already, prepaid meter customers in Bands A – C, who vend from November 1, 2020 will be charged the new tariff, while the same will be implemented for postpaid customers in these bands, during the November billing cycle. It said: “We want to use this opportunity to solicit the continued support and understanding of our customers as we move forward with this new tariff regime, which will enable the Nigeria electricity supply industry cover cost of their operations and ensure improved service delivery. “Lastly, we further wish to assure our customers of our commitment to service improvements in customer service delivery, infrastructural upgrade, metering and technological solutions, within the shortest possible time.”
