Tambuwal, said this at the groundbreaking ceremony of OCP Africa’s $13 million Sokoto Agricultural Centre of Excellence comprising a fertilizer blending plant with a production capacity of 200,000 MT per annum and training facilities for farmers, fertilizer blenders and other stake holders in the agricultural value chain He said Sokoto State has one of the largest deposits of high-quality phosphate in Nigeria, which makes the establishment of the plant there a big step towards making fertilizer readily available and affordable to all farmers in the state and the Northern region.

He explained that citing the plant in Sokoto goes a long way in strengthening and expanding the relationship between the company and the government and people of Sokoto, saying other initiatives done in the state included the setting up of five one-stop shops in Wurno, Goronyo, Tambuwal, IIIelah and Kware to enhance accessibility of inputs to farmers across the State.
