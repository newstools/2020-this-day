By Segun James The presiding Pastor and General Overseer of the Citadel Global Church, Pastor Tunde Bakare, has said he remains confident of succeding President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023 if given the opportunity. He however said his ambition was not a do-or-die affair. Speaking with newsmen in Lagos, Bakare, who clocked 66 years on November 11, also called for the reinvention of a new Nigeria where selflessness will be the driving force for nation building. Bakare,who was the former presidential running mate to Buhari in the 2011 election, said he was not pretending to make his ambition looks like a vision, adding that he will one day be sworn in as the President of Nigeria. “There is something called destiny. I am not one to hide under the umbrella of one finger and make ambition looks like vision, I do not camoflauge. “Its not a matter of life and death, but you can write it down, as the Lord lives, and as I am given opportunity, the day will come like Joe Biden that I will be the President of Nigeria.” Bakare, said, “There is no free freedom anywhere in the world, there must be freedom with boundary. “I am not saying curtail them or we can’t use social media in Nigeria, but there is no nation where there are no balances.” Bakare, who is the advisory council chairman of Royal Commonwealth Society said the excesses happening in the social media especially through fake news can stir up trouble in the country. “Look at the picture of a drama that was shot somewhere else that was used to say soldiers have killed protestsers, those things can grieve and create troubles. “But we cannot be draconian, we are not going back to Decree 4, we must do things decently and orderly, listen to the people and formulate laws that will be beneficial to all of us,” he said.
