By Chuks Okocha Residents of Abuja woke up yesterday to see the campaign posters of the Minister of Transportation, Hon. Rotimi Amaechi for the 2023 presidential election in major streets in the capital city. Interestingly, the posters had the face of the Governor of Kaduna State, Mallam Nasir el- Rufai, as his running mate. The posters emerged about 48 hours after El-Rufai had introduced Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State as someone who the North loves and “can work with”. The occasion was the 50th Anniversary of the Centre for Historical Documentation and Research (Arewa House) in Kaduna. As the Chairman of the Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF), Fayemi has been building strong political machinery ahead of 2023 election. This has seen him clash in his state with forces loyal to the National Leader of the All Progressive Congress (APC), Senator Bola Tinubu who is also believed to have an eye for the presidency in 2023. Fayemi was also among the governors who were rumoured to have mobilised against the former APC National Chairman, Mr. Adams Oshiomole and swept him out of office. It is believed that the Ekiti State governor and the Kaduna State governor were pivotal to the removal of Oshiomhole. They were also said to have collaborated with Amaechi in the anti-Oshiomhole move and were opposed by Tinubu. It was not certain if Amaechi or El-Rufai authorised the printing of the posters But messages on the posters read: “The People’s choice,” “Today may not be the best, but tomorrow will be better”. The posters were sighted in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and some highways in Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). The National Consolidation Movement identified itself as being behind the posters, though no logo of any political party was displayed. As at the time of filing this report, neither Amaechi nor El-Rufai have reacted to the emergence of the posters.
