Last week, we started the discussion on how infertility can affect your emotions, highlighting the symptoms of emotional disturbances and ways to manage them. This week we will continue the discussions on psychological management of emotions in infertility. STEPS IN MANAGING EMOTIONS IN INFERTILITY 4. ALWAYS REMEMBER YOU AND YOUR PARTNER ARE ATEAM. As a team, you must help each other through the challenges of infertility emotionally or in any other way. This doesn’t mean you need to feel the same thing at the same time or expect to have the same emotional experience but it does mean paying attention to what your partner’s going through. Always approach the issues as a team, working together and finding ways to share responsibility regarding treatment. “If you’re taking care of each other emotionally, you can unite to fight the problem and not yourselves. 5. DISTRACT YOURSELF WITH EXCITING ACTIVITIES. Being treated for infertility can feel like a full- or at least part-time job, so it is important to keep up with some of the activities or hobbies that you enjoy. Take vacation trips, go on dates, hang out with friends. Look for ways to put nurturing energies in the relationship, making your partner a priority 6. BUILD UP THE SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP. Infertility often puts strain on a couple’s sexual relationship and what was once fun has now become a tedious job. Your sex life may be the very first victim of trying to conceive stress.Research has found an increase in sexual dysfunction for both for men and women when timed intercourse is used to get pregnant.Remember the ways you enjoyed sex early in your relationship and find ways to recreate it. Understand that sexual intimacy does not have to mean intercourse and use your imagination to plan recreational sex 7. ALLOW YOUR PARTNER TO FEEL DIFFERENTLY Not everyone wears their emotions on their sleeves. At the same time, what looks like an overreaction to you may be perfectly normal for them. Everyone copes differently. You can’t judge how much your partner cares about an experience by looking at them or even by their actions. Offering each other support without preconditions or comparisons is the path to peace. PSYCHOLOGICAL TREATMENT FOR INFERTILITY. 1. See a professional: Mental health professionals who have experience with infertility treatment can be very helpful. Their primary goal is to help individuals and couples learn how to cope with the physical and emotional changes associated with infertility, as well as with medical treatments. Some professionals might choose to focus primarily on how to deal with a partner’s response. Others might spend time discussing how to choose the right medical treatment or how to explore and evaluate other family building options. Some couples might need help controlling stress, anxiety, or depression. Mental health professionals can help individuals work through grief, fear, and other negative emotions related to infertility. Make every effort to find a mental health professional who is familiar with the emotional experience of infertility. The professional should have a clinical training in the psychological aspects of infertility and experiences in the medical and psychological aspects of reproductive medicine. A professional will be useful in:
• Creating positive images of your fertility.
• Rekindle passion and romance with your partner.
• Connect with your symbol of hope.
• Design a container for doubts and negative thoughts.
• Establish a circle of healing and support.
• Help your body feel more fertile. A good therapist has the ability to help others sort out their feelings, strengthen existing coping skills and develop new ones, and communicate with others more effectively. Many have found that their crisis of infertility became an opportunity for life-enhancing personal growth. 2. Listen to soothing music Get focused and relaxed with the soothing subtle and classical music. Music supports you in experiencing your own imagery, making it all the more powerful because it comes from within. It will help you release stress and tension, feel calm, let go of worries and fears, find peace and contentment, create balance 3. Eat healthy and exercise: How you treat your body, can really affect your mindset. When you’re feeling healthy in body, it helps your mind to feel healthy too and vice versa. You may already be following a specific fertility diet or just looking for more ways to be healthy. Being active and eating fresh, unprocessed foods is a great way to boost your mood and help you feel more positive. CONCLUSION One of the most challenging aspects of the infertility experience is dealing with the emotional ups and downs relating to medical treatment, the uncertainty about outcomes, and the challenge of having to make important decisions such as when ‘enough is enough.’ It is important to learn how to take care of yourself, make sure you that get the support you need, and to manage your emotions so that your self-esteem and outlook on life remains as positive as possible. Finally, Trust in God the Giver of Children. Surely you will be on the pathway to successful parenthood. References :asrm.org,www.lifelinkfertility.com,myfuturebaby.org.
