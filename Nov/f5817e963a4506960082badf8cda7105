A new policy that offers protection to online shoppers in Nigeria has been launched by Flutterwave, a fintech company. The new policy would alleviate the fears of online shoppers and boost their confidence and sense of security when using Flutterwave’s payment solutions. The policy was announced recently by Flutterwave when it launched its Payment Protection Promise (PPP) that, “acts as a money-back guarantee to shoppers when an item or service purchased does not arrive, is faulty, damaged on arrival or does not match the item that was listed.” The PPP would strengthen the growing online shopping culture in Nigeria and displace the skepticism associated with patronising e-commerce businesses. The Founder/Chief Executive Officer of Flutterwave, Mr. Olugbenga G.B. Agboola, explained that, “the goal of the PPP is to ensure that all who shop online and pay with Flutterwave are confident that they could shop safely and get value for their money.” Agboola said: “We understand that with the rising online shopping culture in Africa, there are bound to be issues of lack of trust in online businesses and we are using this policy to close that gap. “When anyone sees the Flutterwave logo while shopping online, we want them to feel safe and confident knowing that they are covered. This policy is also beneficial to our merchants as it will boost patronage and sales due to increased customer confidence and assurance of value.” The PPP would permit customers to use the dispute page or support channels via email and live chat on the Flutterwave website and other social media platforms to lodge their complaints. Flutterwave would also enable its customers to build customised payment applications through its APIs. It has active presence in 15 African countries, including Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya and South Africa.
