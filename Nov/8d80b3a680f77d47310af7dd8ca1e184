The Penultimate week was probably a defining one for the #ENDSARS Protests. While an impoverished mass of people stormed warehouses to forcibly recover Covid-19 palliative materials, the Nigerian Broadcasting Commission (NBC) without any justification, levied a N3 million fine each on three of Nigeria’s most credible and authoritative media houses, ARISE TV, AIT and CHANNELS TV. Nigeria’s foremost human rights crusader, Femi Falana, SAN, Emmanuel Onwubiko and Shehu Abdulwaheed Adisa interrogate the complex issues surrounding the #ENDSARS Protests, the role of the Nigeria Police, Army and thugs; whether the purported looting of palliatives was an act of the people taking back what rightfully belongs to them, or a criminal act; and whether the NBC had any justification whatsoever to levy any fine on these media houses
