Ahead of the star match of the weekend in the French Ligue 1 between defending champions Paris Saint-Germain and Bordeaux, manager Jean-Louis Gasset revealed that he had the opportunity to train top players such as Jay-Jay Okocha and Ronaldinho during his time at PSG. For two seasons, the 66-year-old Gasset was Luis Fernández’s right-hand man at PSG who had some household names in their ranks. “In Paris, I had the chance with Luis to train Ronaldinho, Anelka, Okocha, Pochettino, Heinze,” Gaaset told reporters. “It’s the start of my career at the top level. We played in the Europa League but it was the same: the pressure in Paris is terrible, you have to win every game. “ Okocha was once the most expensive African player in history, joining PSG from Fenerbahce for a fee in the region of 14 million pounds after putting himself in the shop window at the 1998 World Cup. With the Parisians, the skillful playmaker won the Trophée des Champions in 1998 and the old UEFA Intertoto Cup in 2001. A three-time World Cupper, Okocha scored 20 goals in 112 appearances for PSG.
