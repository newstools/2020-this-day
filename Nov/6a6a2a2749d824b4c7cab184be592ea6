By Adibe Emenyonu The Aide-de Camp (ADC) to Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State collapsed on the podium during the inauguration of Obaseki for Second Term on Thursday The incident occured when the ADC, a Superintendent of Police, who stood directly behind the newly sworn-in governor, started wobbling before he eventually slumped. While this was going on, Governor Obaseki, who was delivering his speech, was oblivious of the near fatal incident happening behind him. However, as the police officer slumped, two Department of State Services (DSS) personnel, calmly came to the rescue of the police officer and escorted him to the sitting arena. The former Commissioner for Health in the state, Dr. Patrick Okundia, immediate rushed to give the officer first aid. Thereafter, the Superintendent of Police was rushed into a waiting ambulance stationed at the Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium, venue of the inauguration ceremony and taken to the hospital. When contacted on the state of health of the ADC, a senior police officer in Edo State Police Command, who pleaded anonymity, sad “the officer is in stable condition”. The source said: “We have no doubt about the state of health of the concerned officer. People do fall ill and with the stress of rehearsals, movement and other activities of the officer’s principal in preparation for the ceremony, such an incident can happen. That shows our humanity and there is no cause for alarm. All our officers and men are in good shape and nobody should use an isolated case like that to judge how healthy the men and officers of the Command are.” Before Obaseki’s ADC collapsed, a lady who was one of the paramilitary guard of honour had also slumped and was quietly taken out of the parade as the governor was about to inspect the guard of honour.
