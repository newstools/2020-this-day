The stock market capitalisation hit N16.207 trillion last week following sustained demand for equities.
The unprecedented demand for stocks had lifted the market by N1.93 trillion to close the month of October at N15.958 trillion. Although some level of profit taking was recorded, the positive performance was sustained in the first week of November, driving indices to new highs.
Precisely, the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) All-Share Index rose 1.56 per cent to close at 31,016.17, while market capitalisation added N249 billion to be at N16.207 trillion.
Consequently, the year-to-date (YTD) performance improved to 15.6 per cent, with analysts saying there was still scope for expansion going forward. “As the Q3 earnings season winds down, we expect investors to shift their attention to yet to be published results from the big banks in the week ahead. In the short term, we still see scope for expansion in valuation multiples as hunt for alpha-yielding opportunities in the face of increasingly negative real returns in the fixed income market remain positive for stocks. “However, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the weak macro environment remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings,” analysts at Cordros Research said. Also commenting, analysts at Greenwich Research said: “Positive sentiment, boosted by impressive earnings performance continued to spur interest in the equities space, in the face of record low yields in the fixed income space. Notably, gains recorded at the start and the end of the week pinned the market in the green zone. “We expect this momentum will be sustained by positive Q3 earnings results, particularly from the banking space.”
