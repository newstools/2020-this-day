Arsenal are away at Norwegian club Molde, while Leicester City travel to Braga and both will be assured of advancing to the next round with a victory this evening.

Leicester are in a very similar situation to their London rivals. After winning 4-0 at home against Braga at the beginning of the month, they know that a victory in Portugal will be see them go through. For Tottenham Hotspur, a 1-0 defeat in Belgium against Antwerp on matchday two sees Jose Mourinho’s team on six points in Group J, with Antwerp and Austrian club LASK also on six points. Victory at home against Ludogorets Razgrad will be a major step towards the knockout stage, but will not be enough to prematurely ensure Spurs a place in the next rounds. “StarTimes subscribers can share the excitement live with their loved ones by linking their decoder’s smartcard number to StarTimes-ON mobile app on up to three mobile devices; this enables them to stream all StarTimes content on their mobile devices at no extra cost,” observed the pay channel in a statement.
