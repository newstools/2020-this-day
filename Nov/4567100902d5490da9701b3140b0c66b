Multiple award-winning Nigerian journalist Adesewa Josh has been announced as the host of the new African focused segment on TRT World International. The international media committed to building a global community focused around change, launched ‘African Matters’ to drive meaningful conversations from the continent that go beyond headlines. The platform seeks to unpack the issues behind each story, ensuring true but fair news, and promoting representation of African storytellers in its newsrooms. As the host of the ‘African Matters’, Adesewa is expected to bring to bear her versatile experience and knowledge garnered in different journalism institutions in Nigeria, United States and Turkey. “Wrong narratives imprison the subject of a story and anyone or anything associated with it. It can negatively affect a wide range of social interactions from interpersonal relations to business associations,” said Adesewa. She further added that: “While it’s incumbent on the rest of the world to educate themselves about Africa, preferably by travelling and reading books, not by one google search, we as Africans must tell our own stories too. No one else can do it better.” TRT World through ‘African Matters’ is set to tell the stories of over 40 countries across sub-Saharan Africa and over one billion people, to the eyes and ears of audiences across the globe. The show will draw an enviable guest list of African speakers, fact-checkers, businessmen and women. Viewers across Africa can watch the show every Friday, 12:30GMT on the network’s website. Audience in the East African countries can, however, catch the news segment on LG Smart TV Satellite and TSTV, while viewers of the show in the horn of Africa can watch on Habeshaview TV, TRT World is available on Roku, Opera TV, and many other smart TV devices.
