Sunday Okobi The United Niger Delta Energy Development Security Service (UNDEDSS) has announced that it has stopped further discussions with the federal government on issues and plights of the people of the Niger Delta. Rising from an emergency virtual meeting yesterday, the group said all future cooperation with the federal government has ceased. In a statement issued after the meeting yesterday through its Secretary-General, Mr. Tony Uranta, which was made available to THISDAY, the group said the decision would remain until the 16-point demand laid directly before President Muhammadu Buhari in 2016 is urgently and comprehensively met as promised by the president at a parley held in Aso Villa with representatives of the group and the Niger Delta leaders. According to the statement, “Niger Delta will mark any putative regional leaders who will attempt to break the no-more-dialogue position of the group. “Enough is enough. We shall no longer remain in a union where we are third class citizens.” UNDEDSS had in the past urged President Buhari to ensure that the forensic audit he ordered the Interim Management Committee (IMC) of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) to execute is speedily carried out without tainting the process, or further shortchanging the region. Uranta had in a statement stated that the resolution followed an Emergency Virtual Executive meeting. Uranta had said: “UNDEDSS has repeatedly decried the quantum of corruption that has become the trademark of the NDDC and the governments of the Niger Delta states, and we have been totally in support of the current renewed anti-corruption stance and directives of President Buhari. “Especially the demand that a comprehensive forensic audit be carried out as directed by the president, and that those indicted be made to face the full consequences of criminality in courts of law.“
