Martins Ifijeh in New Jersey, USA The Presidential Candidate of the Democratic Party, Joe Biden has described as outrageous, unprecedented and incorrect President Donald Trump’s call for vote counting to be stopped. Speaking through his campaign manager, Jen O’Malley Dillon, Wednesday, he said it was uncalled for because it represents a naked effort to take away the democratic rights of American citizens. He said: “It was unprecedented because never before in our history has a president of the United States sought to strip Americans of their voice in a national election. Having encouraged Republican efforts in multiple states to prevent the legal counting of these ballots before Election Day, now Donald Trump is saying these ballots can’t be counted after Election Day either. “And it was incorrect because it will not happen. The counting will not stop. It will continue until every duly cast vote is counted. Because that is what our laws — the laws that protect every Americans’ constitutional right to vote — require. “We repeat what the Vice President said tonight: Donald Trump does not decide the outcome of this election. Joe Biden does not decide the outcome of this election. The American people decide the outcome of this election. And the democratic process must and will continue until its conclusion,” he said.
