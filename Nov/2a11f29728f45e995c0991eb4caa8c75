By Tosin Clegg Brandon Hamilton, professionally known as Blue, is a Grammy nominated American music producer from Atlanta with production credits for Justin Beiber, Robin Thicke, August Alsina, D woods, and a lot more. As a multi-platinum record producer and songwriter, Blue’s indispensable assets are his ears as he enjoys music mellow stating, “I don’t turn the music up just because I’m making it. I keep it a little low while I’m creating, if it makes me rock when the volume is on two, I’m confident others will feel it too”. This is the confidence that led Blue to the discovery of Walter Spearheart, who is a multidisciplinary performing and recording artiste. With over 15 years in the industry, Spearheart is versatile with the violin, guitar and the traditional Celtic Harp. For Walter, the message his art conveys is “healing”. He views his art as a tool to help connect, heal and flow in a positive stream of consciousness. Blue and Spearheart met a while back and were able to form a bond that translates beyond the music. The producer and artiste duo have similar core values and have joined hands to take Walter’s art to the global scale. Speaking on collaborating with Blue, Spearheart believes the timing of them coming together is just perfect for the shift the world is currently experiencing: “2020 shook the world and my outlook on life made me see the changes around me in a positive light. Blue and I have been working, making music that will touch lives and help see the beauty of life lies with us and our ability to show and receive love” The duo held a private showcase at Oti’s in Lagos on November 25th, 2020 with key industry players in attendance. The showcase was an electrifying feeling that brought life back to the heart of Lagos.
