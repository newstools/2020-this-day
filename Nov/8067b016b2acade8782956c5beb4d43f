Cristiano Ronaldo could play at another elite club in Europe before he hangs up his boots for good with the Juventus star unlikely to remain at the club beyond 2022, according to reports. The 35-year-old vowed to play into his 40s back in 2016 and has just two years left on his current deal in Italy. The Portugal star may leave Juventus when his contract expires due to his ‘unromantic’ relationship with the club, according to Tuttosport. The report claims that French giants Paris Saint-Germain could be interested in making a move for Ronaldo but the MLS and China are out of the equation as he wants to play at the highest level in Europe until he’s 40. “It’ll depend on how I feel, on my motivation, because physically it won’t be a problem,” Ronaldo told Marca last year when discussing retirement. “You have to treat yourself well, but I don’t think that’s the most important factor. It’s more the psychological side that’ll make a difference.” Ronaldo has scored a staggering 643 goals in 853 matches in club football and is showing no signs of slowing down. The five-time Ballon d’Or winner returned to action after recovering from coronavirus in sensational style last weekend by scoring two goals after coming off the bench. Ronaldo was in action on Tuesday when Juventus played Ferencvaros and it was his first UEFA Champions League match of the season.
