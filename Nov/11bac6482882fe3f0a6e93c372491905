For years policemen in Ogwashi-Uku Police Station and the entire Aniocha South Local Govt Area of Delta State have engaged in police brutality, extortion, intimidation and violations of rights of indigenes of the area. But the Ogwashi-Uku Police Station is most notorious for extortion in form of bails, besides asking people to bring money for paper and biro for writing statements, claiming that government didnâ€™t provide them with materials. Please we need the authorities to intervene. We are tired. Eziokwubundu Atuegwu, Abuja
