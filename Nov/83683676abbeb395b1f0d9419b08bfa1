Super Eagles Captain, Ahmed Musa, is being linked with a move to Turkish Super Lig giants Galatasaray, according to various reports in Turkey including Fotomac. The former Leicester City striker is currently a free agent after mutually terminating his contract with Saudi Arabian Pro League side Al Nassr. The report claims that supporters pressurized the powers that be at Al Nassr to part company with the Nigeria international due to his dwindling form and he was not motivated in Saudi Arabia because he felt the league was below his standard. Musaâ€™s agent is in contact with Galatasaary chiefs over a transfer and a deal might be in the offing if his demands are met. In 55 appearances for Al Nassr, Musa found the net on eleven occasions and set up fourteen goals. The 28-year-old began his career in Europe with VVV Venlo in the Netherlands before moving to CSKA Moscow. If he joins Galatasaray, he would link up with another Super Eagles star Oghenekaro Etebo and Jesse Sekidika at the club.
