Super Eagles winger, Samuel Chukwueze, ended his almost one year LaLiga goal drought last night as he netted his first in the 2-0 defeat of Real Valladolid. The Nigerian international opened scoring in the 21st minute with a classy left-foot finish while Pau Torres scored the second in the 37th. That win has now taken Villarreal to the third spot of the LaLiga standing. Real Sociedad occupy first place with Real Madrid a point back in second. Atletico Madrid are another two points behind but have two games in hand on the leaders. Chukwueze last scored in Spain’s topflight November last year in a 3-1 home defeat to Celta Vigo. Although the Super Eagles winger was later replaced by Takefusa Kubo in the 64th minute, his performance on the night must have earned him high marks in Super Eagles’ chief handler’s reckoning ahead of Nigeria’s AFCON 2022 qualifier against Sierra Leone on November 13 in Benin City. Villarreal are unbeaten in seven games in all competitions since a 4-0 defeat by Barcelona on 27 September.
