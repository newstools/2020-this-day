An #EndSARS protester, Mr. Peter Eromosele Adene, yesterday regained his freedom after spending 12 days in police custody. One of the lawyers who provided legal aid to the protesters, Moe Odele, shared a video showing a once-again freed Eromosele via her Twitter handle yesterday. Eromosele, who was arrested on November 7 by the police in Lagos, was released from police detention on the order of a Magistrate Court in Yaba. Plot by the police to remand Eromosele for 30 days was Monday uncovered by his lawyer. The policemen had last week arrested the #EndSARS protester in Ikeja and taken to the police command headquarters from where he was transferred to the Area F Command before detaining him at the SCID, Panti. He was then flown to Abuja and detained for seven days before being brought back to Lagos last Sunday. However, rather than charge him, the policemen secretly approached an Yaba Magistrate Court presided over by Magistrate O.A Salau, for a remand order to detain him for an extra 30 days without the consent of his lawyer. Eromoseleâ€™s lawyer, Mr. Tunde Jinadu, who was at the SCID, was told by policemen that his client was no longer in
custody. However, Jinadu immediately received words from concerned persons about what the police were up to. On arrival at the court, the policemen were shocked and wondered how the lawyer was able to get information on what was happening. He was later arraigned on Tuesday where the magistrate granted him bail in the sum of N1million.
