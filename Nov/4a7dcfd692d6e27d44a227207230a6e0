By Adedayo Akinwale with agency report The International Criminal Court (ICC) has said it’s conducting a preliminary examination into the recent #EndSARS protests in Nigeria. It also said it would make findings of the preliminary examination public. The office of the ICC prosecutor in a statement issued Wednesday said it had received information on alleged crimes. It said, “The examination will assess whether the legal criteria for opening an investigation under the Rome Statute are met”. The #EndSARS protesters gathered in streets in major towns of the country to demonstrate against police brutality for weeks, leading to a crackdown. The BBC report that the crackdown on peaceful protesters saw about 51 civilians, 11 police officers and seven soldiers killed. Rights group Amnesty International said security forces opened fire on protesters, killing and injuring a number of people. Both the police and the army have rejected Amnesty’s allegation.
