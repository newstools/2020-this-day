Tyson Fury’s dispute with Deontay Wilder over a third fight could disrupt plans for an undisputed world title clash with Anthony Joshua, says promoter Eddie Hearn. Fury was set to announce a homecoming clash against Agit Kabayel in December, but has entered into a mediation process with Wilder after failing to agree terms for another WBC heavyweight title fight. Unified champion Joshua will face IBF mandatory challenger Kubrat Pulev on December 12, but Hearn is unsure whether Fury can still press ahead with a blockbuster battle next year. He told Sky Sports: “We try and avoid the mess, and keep discipline and focus on what we’re doing, and the path for AJ has always been clear, with the ups and downs of the Ruiz fight, and getting that rematch over the line. “But we know what we’re doing. December 12, it was announced probably eight weeks before the fight, we’re focused on the victory.
“That’s their (Fury and Wilder’s) business, it’s a right mess either way, and it’s not going to resolve itself any time soon. “Hopefully we can just make sure that if Anthony Joshua can beat Kubrat Pulev on December 12, then the path is clear for AJ against Fury in 2021.” Asked if the Joshua vs Fury schedule could become more complicated, Hearn said: “If the legal action rumbles on, because ultimately, after that fight with Pulev, we want to be in a position to say ‘This is the fight for the undisputed’.”
