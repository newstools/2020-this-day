By Udora Orizu The Minority Caucus in the House of Representatives has congratulated former President Goodluck Jonathan on his 63rd birthday, describing him as an outstanding statesman and quintessential democrat. The caucus, in a statement signed by its leader, Hon. Ndudi Elumelu, said Jonathan is an extraordinary leader, a shinning example of a detribalized Nigerian, whose sense of honesty, humility, selflessness and love for all Nigerians, as well as commitment and personal sacrifices for the unity and stability of the nation saved her corporate existence and laid the solid foundation for the national unanimity the nation enjoys today. The caucus said: ”Over the years, as the deputy governor and later governor of Bayelsa State; vice-president and subsequently the president of our dear country, and now a global statesman, Dr. Jonathan has continued to exhibit uncommon leadership virtues in seeking only the good of our nation and humanity at large. As president, Jonathan led critical reforms that strengthened our national unity, deepened our democracy, reinforced the credibility of our electoral system, nurtured our national economy to become one of the fastest growing in the world, and repositioned the front line sectors of agriculture, education, power, aviation, healthcare, finance, transport, works among others, to achieve unprecedented productivity level ever, in the history of our nation. ”Jonathan’s approach to politics, particularly, in conceding to unfavourable electoral outcome stands him out as the father of modern democracy and a reference point for political sportsmanship all over the world. His current role in ensuring the unity, stability and progress of other countries of the world, particularly in Africa, further shows his commitment as a global citizen and leader. The Minority Caucus therefore joins other Nigerians, friends, associates and members of the international community in congratulating President Jonathan and praying God to grant him many more years in active service to our dear fatherland and humanity in general.”
