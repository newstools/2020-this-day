By Kasim Sumaina The federal government has lifted the flight ban on Lufthansa, KLM and Air France, paving the way for them to resume operations in and out of the country. The Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika, made this known in a statement by the Director, Public Affairs, Ministry of Aviation, in Abuja, Tuesday. He said: “Qatar Airways has also been granted approval to start operations at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport Abuja.” Sirika said this follows the approval of their respective flight plans and schedules submitted to the ministry. He also emphasized the need for airlines operating in the country to employ international best practices in handling Nigerian passengers, noting that the government will not tolerate any form of maltreatment of its citizens by any airline. To this end, he said that all the nation’s international airports may resume international flight operations before the end of the year. The minister said that the Ministry of Aviation is working with the Federal Ministry of Health, the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 and other relevant bodies to ensure that the airports meet all the safety and health requirements and protocols. According to him, “The international airports that are yet to be cleared to resume operations are the Port Harcourt Airport, the Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport and the Akanu Ibiam International Airport Enugu.” He stated that all hands will be on deck to ensure that all logistic and policy necessities are soon in place in order to address the difficulties encountered by international travellers, especially with the forthcoming yuletide season. The minister, in the statement, expressed his appreciation for the understanding and cooperation of Aviation stakeholders in ensuring the smooth reopening of the nation’s airspace.
