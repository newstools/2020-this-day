Sunday Okobi An independent online media platform, which specialises in technology reporting mostly from Africa, AskIfa, has been launched as TechUncode in Lagos. At the event which took place in Lagos recently, the Chief Executive Officer of the platform, Mr. Charles Edosomwan, described TechUncode as a unique tech news platform that would communicate everything about technology in a simplified and interesting way that will inspire world-renowned technological innovative solutions from Africa. According to him, “There is a need to tell the story of Africa from an African view. “All over the world, it is believed that Africans consume technology rather than invent it. It is thought that most world-leading software and hardware solutions are primarily from other continents of the world. This may be true or not. “However, what we seek to do is to change the narrative about Africa and technology. Our goal is to inspire world-leading technology solutions in Africa through our simplified content.” Edosomwan added that: “TechUncode has taken the mantle to light up the path leading to a technological revolution for a continent hungry for possibilities.” He emphasised that with TechUncode’s rich content, in-depth analysis, events, webinars, and exclusive interviews, the platform would put past and current tech heroes in the spotlight. Speaking on the launch of the platform, the General Manager, Arinola Gelor, said the rebrand was initiated to further emphasise the unique essence of TechUncode, and to ensure its content and events create a sustained transformative impact that will resonate with the audience.
