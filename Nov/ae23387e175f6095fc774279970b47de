By Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja The Egyptian authorities have said that seven out of the eight #EndSARS Nigerians, who protested in Egypt on October 18, would be deported to Nigeria for lack of resident permits/visas. The Chairman, Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NIDCOM), Hon. Abike Dabiri-Erewa, who has been following the matter, confirmed this in a statement on Tuesday in Abuja. Dabiri-Erewa, however, denied the allegation that the Federal Government of Nigeria was involved in the Nigerians’ arrest, adding that the Nigerians were not arrested at the Nigerian Embassy but at another location. She explained that the only Nigerian among them, who has residency permit, would get final clearance from the Egyptian Interior Minister, Mahmoud Tawfik, after signing an undertaking not to be involved in any unauthorised activities while still in the country. Dabiri-Erewa stated: “The Nigerian mission in Cairo has had extensive deliberations with the Cairo Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Interior as well as the Diplomatic Police, and the eight detained Nigerians, four men and four women, were assured of decent treatment while in detention.” She reiterated her appeals to Nigerians abroad to be good ambassadors of the country by being law abiding to the laws of their respective host countries.
