Minimum Generation: 3,618.58MW (7th October). Maximum stranded generation was recorded on 6th October where stranded power totaled 4,401.5MW (Gas: 1,717.5 and DisCos Low load demand: 2,684MW),” the document read. “Average generation for October 2020 of 4,162MW represents the maximum monthly generation in the year 2020. Of the total constraint recorded, gas constraint accounted for 47.5%, while load rejection by DisCos accounted for 52.5%. “Total Capacity Loss from January to October 2020: N243.82 Billion” On Thursday, the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) said the power sector recorded an all-time national peak of 5,459.50 megawatts (MW).
