Leaders of the South-South geopolitical zone in Lagos have continued their visits to some government property destroyed during the EndSARS protest in the state and have tasked the youths on peace Some of the areas visited included Ajeromi LGA, Lagos Mainland LGA, BRT Terminal Oyingbo and police stations. Lagos Commissioner for Budget and Economic Planning, Mr. Lucky Egube, who is of Niger Delta origin, led the team. The South-South forum’s chairman, Mr. Isaac Emiyede, who is recuperating from surgery and was recently attacked during the #EndSARS protest, sent a message of solidarity. Egube had earlier led a team to TVC Communications that was also attacked by the arsonists and other miscreants. At all the places visited, Egube and Emiyede urged the youths and other Nigerians to embrace peace and dialogue in resolving issues. They said that youths should not destroy public property as leaders of tomorrow who will inherit these legacies that they helped to build. Egube said youths should resist the temptation of being used by self-seeking politicians to destroy government and other public properties that they helped to build, including the edifices and laudable infrastructure being put in place by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu. “Since the return to civil rule, much has been achieved in Lagos under the administrations of Bola Tinubu and others and I enjoin everyone in the state to protect such public property and support the current governor to achieve more,” Egube added. Emiyede who also commiserated with Tinubu, the state government and others who lost property and their loved ones, urged security agencies to diligently fish out arsonists and looters. Others in the delegation who spoke in a similar vein included Chief Lucky Oyakhire who stood in for Emiyede, S’South women leader, Mrs. Christine Emiko and Chief Frank Akata.
