Former Deputy Governor of Lagos State, Alhaja Sinatu Aderoju Ojikutu, has urged Nigeria to adopt the second stanza of the national anthem, positing that in it lies the path to divine intervention in the affairs of the country. In her message to Nigerians and Nigerian leaders, the former deputy governor said “we have the means to call on God but we are not using it.” Noting that in the second stanza of the Nigerian national anthem are words of prayer for the nation, its leaders and youths, the former deputy governor said, “I am appealing to everybody in Nigeria, traders, artisans, doctors as long as you can read and write, please learn this stanza and begin to recite it all the time.” According to her, that particularly stanza is calling on God to help Nigeria’s noble cause and guide its leaders right at the national level, at the state level and local government level, and to let the youths know the truth. Reciting the second stanza of the national anthem, she said: “Oh God of creation, direct our noble cause. Guide our leaders right, help our youths the truth to know. In love and honesty to grow and living just and true. Great lofty heights attain. To build a nation where peace and justice shall reign.” She feared that Nigeria was on the brink of disastrous change and needed God to come to its aid, adding that if Nigeria heeds her advice, all the drums of war being beaten will cease.” “I find it necessary to make this call to Nigerians at home and abroad, she said in the audio clip, adding “we have a tool to call on God in our hands but we are not using it.” Expressing confidence that the second stanza of Nigeria’s national anthem is a prayer that the Almighty will answer, Ojikutu said this message had been in her heart for over 30 years.
