By Adedayo Akinwale The war of words between the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) over the rescue operation carried out in Nigeria by the United States Seal team to rescue her citizen continued yesterday with the APC accusing the main opposition party of having penchant for diverting and sharing counter-insurgency funds to its political cronies. The PDP had in a statement said the swift operation by the United States to rescue her citizen held hostage by bandits on Nigerian soil has further confirmed that President Muhammadu Buhari Presidency can neither secure the territorial integrity of the nation nor arrest the wave of insecurity ravaging our country under its inept watch. But the APC in its reaction accused the main opposition party of playing politics with national security. The Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the party, Mr. Yekini Nabena, in a statement said the ruling party would not be dragged into an exchange with the PDP in its plot to gain selfish and insensitive political capital from issues of national security. He insisted that as with the case of Saturday’s rescue of a kidnapped American citizen in Nigeria by US special forces, combating terrorism and other emerging cross border crimes require international collaborations and assistance when necessary. Nabena said: “We don’t expect the PDP to understand this international best practice going by its evil penchant of diverting and sharing counter-insurgency funds to its political cronies and its criminal and negligent handling of the 2014 abduction of 276 Chibok schoolgirls while claiming a grand political conspiracy against it. “Unlike previous PDP governments, the President Muhammadu Buhari-led APC government is not “sleeping on the wheel” on serious national concerns.”
