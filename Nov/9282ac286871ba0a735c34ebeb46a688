Chuks Okocha in Abuja Former President of the Senate, Dr. Abubakar Bukola Saraki, has called on leaders across the North Central geo-political zone to push for the development, peace and unity of the region. Saraki, who said this when the executives and a cross-section of members of the North Central Peoples’ Forum paid him a courtesy visit at his home in Maitama, Abuja, emphasised that the development of the North Central zone is in the interest of the entire nation. the former Senate President said: “If it is about development for our people, you have my support. This initiative aimed at development is long overdue. “If you talk about the unity of this country, you must factor in the North Central. If you are talking about the future of this country, it lies on many of the resources like minerals and agriculture that our region has. This is why forums like this are crucial — because it will give us a credible platform to push for the holistic development of our region. “My father of blessed memory, and other leaders like Chief Sunsay Awoniyi have all tried very hard to support the mobilisation of the people for the development of the North Central region. As a result of this, I have always been very committed to the development of the region in particular because it plays a crucial role in the development of the entire nation. “All of us that have worked for other zones to have their development commissions, it is time for us to seek the support of those zones to have ours — in order to promote the long-term sustainable development of our regions and our people.”
Earlier in the meeting, the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the group, retired Lt. Gen. Useni, commended Saraki for his work for the region, while bestowing on him the title of ‘Patron of the Forum’ for his remarkable contributions and achievements over the years.
