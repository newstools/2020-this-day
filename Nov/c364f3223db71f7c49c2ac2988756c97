Oghenevwede Ohwovoriole in Abuja Director General, National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), Brig. Gen. Shuaibu Ibrahim has advised Corps members to stop thinking of paid employment after graduation but to think of creating wealth through acquired skills. A press release signed by the NYSC Director, Press and Public Relations, Adenike Adeyemi, said Ibrahim stated this while addressing the 2020 Batch ‘B’ Stream IA Corps members at Orientation Camps in Sokoto and Kebbi states. Ibrahim advised the Corps members to discover their God-given talents and harness it for wealth and job creation. “Don’t wait for white collar jobs. Respect the dignity of labour, be focused and be committed. Discover your talents and work towards harnessing them and the sky will be your limit,” he said. He urged them to acquire skills that would make them wealth creators instead of seeking for scarce salary jobs. While educating the Corps members on the four Cardinal Programmes of the NYSC, he admonished them to always be patriotic and of good conduct, adding that “as future leaders, you must be exemplary in your conduct.” Ibrahim urged the Corps members to shun religious intolerance and ethnic bigotry, and instead be in the vanguard for the promotion of national unity and integration. In addition he advised them to be security conscious, avoid social vices and any act capable of jeopardising their future.
He also used the opportunity to visit Eurotor Rita Kefe, a Corps member who is receiving treatment at the State Orthopedic Hospital, Wamakko, following injuries sustained in a road accident.
