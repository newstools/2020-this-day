The stock market declined by 2.5 per cent last week following profit taking after weeks of sustained growth. The market, which spiked by 12.9 per cent the previous week, closed lower last week as the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) All-Share Index (ASI) shedding 2.5 per cent to be at 34,136.82. The market capitalisation closed lower at N17.838 trillion. Despite the decline, analysts at Cordros Research said in the short to medium term, they still see scope for expansion in valuation multiples as the depressed yield environment remains compelling for yield-seeking investors to rebalance their portfolio towards equities. “In the week ahead((this week), we expect a mixed market performance due to continued profit-taking activities and positioning by early birds in dividend-paying stocks ahead of full year (FY) 2020 dividend declarations. We reiterate the need for positioning in only fundamentally sound stocks as the weak macro environment remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings,” the analysts said.
