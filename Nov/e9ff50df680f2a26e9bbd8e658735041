US President Donald Trump has won in Florida, defeating former Vice President Joe Biden in the largest of the traditional swing states. With the victory in Florida, Trump has secured the 29 electoral college votes in the must-win swing state and preserving a key part of what is perhaps his most likely path to reelection. The outcome in Florida, Trump’s adopted home state, is among the most – if not the most – crucial for the president, who had staked his reelection hopes in no small part on recreating his 2016 win in a state notorious for its unpredictable and closely decided elections. In a sign of the importance he placed on Florida, Trump officially declared residency there last year.
