Liverpool’s Sadio Mane was the highlight of the opening day of Match-day three of the 2022 AFCON qualifiers on Wednesday evening. Mane created one and scored one in Senegal’s 2-0 defeat of Guinea-Bissau. He took advantage of some pretty poor Guinea-Bissau defending and sets up Opa Nguette with a crisp pass for the second goal. With Mane netting a penalty in the first half, that goal put this game beyond the reach of Senegal’s next door neighbour That victory puts the AFCON 2019 runners up comfortable at the top of Group I on maximum nine points. The other teams in the group, Congo and Eswatini are playing this evening. Elsewhere, Guinea sustained their first half lone goal lead against Chad and grabbed all to go three points clear at the summit on seven points. Mali on four points will attempt to go back level on points with Guinea when they host Namibia on Friday. In Group E, Burundi scored their first goal of the group phase, which enabled them force a deadlock 1-1 against Mauritania and earned their first point. Mauritania meanwhile go ahead of the rest of the teams, a point better than Morocco, who host Central African Republic on Friday. The Harambe Stars of Kenya forced Comoros Island to a 1-1 draw and moved to second spot on three points. Comoros will remain on top of the table while awaiting Egypt’s fixture at home against Togo on Saturday. The Pharaohs are three points shy of the Comoros, who also have a goal advantage.
