Adeniran who spoke during the 2021 budget defence of agencies under the Ministry of Works and Housing at the National Assembly Complex, Abuja, emphasised the importance of large scale mapping that could help the federal government achieve much in terms of Internally Generated Revenue (IGR), effective policing, planning and economic development. The statement noted that in view of the critical functions of the office, the House Committee on Works and Housing, expressed the need for the review of the Survey Coordination Act of 1962. Chairman of the committee, Hon.
