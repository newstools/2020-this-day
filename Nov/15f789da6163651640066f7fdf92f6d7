With the Presidential pardoning of Michael Flynn, and previously a Turkey named Corn who will be the next to be pardoned? There could be family, friends, co-workers or technically every person in prison. The family option is not new as Bill Clinton pardoned his brother, Roger. The real question is who will or can pardon President Trump if they wish to? There is some doubt as to whether he could pardon himself and waiting for the incoming President Biden to issue pardons might be risky. President Trump could take a day off, by ‘illness’ and VP Pence could then fill in and pardon Trump. Of course, this is only a theoretical possibility and surely there is no need to pardon anyone else. Dennis Fitzgerald,
