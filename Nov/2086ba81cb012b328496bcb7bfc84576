* Says visit an apology from APC to PDP for misgovernance Chuks Okocha in Abuja The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Sunday said that the visit by governors elected on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to former President Goodluck Jonathan had further affirmed that Nigeria, as a nation, was better under PDP. The PDP also said the visit of the APC governors to former President Jonathan’ was an open apology to the PDP and Nigerians for its maladministration and mismanagement of the economy. The visit, the PDP said, is a clear endorsement of the acceptability of the PDP administration, also indicates that the APC, in 2015, only created artificial symbols of misgovernance, corruption and other alleged misgivings just to discredit our party and grab the levers of power to achieve their selfish desires. A statement issued by the National Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, said it was evident that the Jonathan administration succeeded in office basically because the PDP understands the nuances of the nation, which it translated into people-oriented polices and programmes, in line with the manifesto of the party, to make life comfortable for Nigerians. The spokesperson of the party, said, “This visit to Jonathan by the APC governors is a direct acceptance of the successes recorded by our party in building a strong nation with a virile economy that was rated as one of the fastest growing economies of the world. “The visit is therefore a subtle step by APC governors into the corridors of the PDP in agreement that our party holds the solution to the myriads of problems brought to our nation by their APC and President Muhammadu Buhari.” The PDP therefore said that it views and received the visit by APC governors as an apology by the APC to it and Nigerians over the lies, beguilements and other irresponsible allegations deployed by the APC to grab power, only to lead the nation on a journey to nowhere. “We therefore caution Nigerians to be watchful of the antics of the APC that have failed in governance and the management of its own affairs. “For us in the PDP, the unity, stability, progress and development of our dear nation remain paramount and as such, we will not allow the failed APC and its pranksters, who have betrayed the trust of Nigerians, to mislead them once again”, the PDP stated.
