A member of the Committee, Kabir Wudil, retired Director and former Special Assistant to the Chief of Staff to the President described the setting up of the Committee as an introspection capable of transforming SON towards greater contributions to Nation building.

Salim, enumerated the Committeeâ€™s terms of reference to include control and coordination, communication and effectiveness, manpower dispositions and manning levels, recruitment, postings and transfers as well as public perception of the organisation and its services among others.
