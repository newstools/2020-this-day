bY Victor Ogunje The Ekiti State Council of Traditional Rulers has commiserated with its counterpart in Ondo State on the shocking and dastardly killing of the Olufon of Ifon, Oba Adegoke Adeusi . The monarch, who ruled Ifon, headquarters of Ose local government area of Ondo State for over 20 years, was killed by gunmen on 26th November, 2020 by criminal elements. The Chairman of Ekiti State Council of Traditional Rulers and the Alawe of Ilawe Ekiti, Oba Adebanji Ajibade Alabi, who spoke on behalf of his colleagues also consoled members of the immediate family of the late Olufon, praying to God to grant them the fortitude to bear this great loss. This was contained in a statement signed by Oba Alabi’s Special Adviser on Media, Olubunmi Ajibade, in Ado Ekiti, on Saturday. The monarch also appealed to the Governor of Ondo State, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu to take the sudden demise of Olufon with equanimity and prayed that the good Lord will expose the killers in no distant time . Oba Alabi said: “it was unfortunate and painful that the Olufon was killed by unknown gunmen while on his way to his domain after an official engagement and prayed that God will grant his soul eternal rest. “This ugly development was worrisome and injurious to the tradition and customs of Yoruba land. “The death of the late Olufon has further buttressed and amplified the point that the issue of insecurity should be handled with with the seriousness it deserves. “I call on the Federal and state governments to further increase adequate air and land surveillance to be able to know the hideouts of the criminals for appropriate action. “I appeal to all Nigerians to be security conscious and be ready to support government in the onerous task of ensuring security in our communities. “The time is now for Amotekun to commence its operational phase throughout the South West geopolitical zone as a panacea for insecurity in the zone, especially during this season of yuletide”.
