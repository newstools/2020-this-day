He further alleged that the suspects were found with incriminating items including locally-made guns, life cartridges, charms, weed suspected to be Indian hemp, substances suspected to be cocaine, and items possibly looted from various shopping outlets within the state during the recent EndSARS violence. Before the mass arrest, the State Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, had warned and directed officers to move against lawlessness and criminality in the state. Odumosu emphasised the zeal of the command to sustain the operations even beyond the yuletide season.

The police boss further encouraged those whose items were looted during the recent EndSARS violence to come and claim their items with prove of ownership. While charging the officers to be at alert for more operations across the state, Odumosu commended the officers for the successful operations.
