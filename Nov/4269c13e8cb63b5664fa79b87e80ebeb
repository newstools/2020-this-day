By Udora Orizu in Abuja The members of the House of Representatives Committee on Diaspora Matter on Tuesday demanded an apology from the Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NIDCOM) for failure to appear for budget defence. The Commission was scheduled to appear before the Committee to defend its 2021 budget estimate but after over two hours, the Chairman of the Commission, Abike Dabiri Erewa, was yet to arrive the meeting venue. Staff of the Commission had said the NIDCOM boss, had gone to the Senate and will soon arrive for the meeting. But, members of the Committee expressed disappointment over the absence of the NIDCOM Chairman saying she must apologize to the committee before a new date will be set for her appearance. Before adjourning the session, Chairman of the Committee, Hon Tolulope Akande-Sadipe said the Committee members were not the type she would keep waiting when she was duly informed of the time for the meeting, but choose to go to the Senate, while keeping them waiting.
