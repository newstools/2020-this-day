By Benjamin Nworie Ebonyi State Governor has reduced the school fees of students of the Ebonyi State University to cushion the effects of COVID-19 pandemic. In a statement issued by the Secretary to Ebonyi State Government (SSG) and the Coordinating Commissioner, Dr. Kenneth Ugbala, the governor also directed that the remaining school fees should be aggregated and paid next year to the university’s account. According to the governor, the state government is aware of the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on the world economy of which Ebonyi State is highly affected. The governor noted that the directive was to lessen the burdens on parents, especially in catering for the students of the state university, as well as encourage more students to go to the university. He said: “All non-indigenes of Ebonyi State University school fees are reduced by N10,000 per student, while school fees for all indigenes of the state in the Ebonyi State University are reduced by N20, 000 per student. “This amount will be aggregated and paid directly to the Ebonyi State University management in 2021. Last week, the state government released all monthly subventions owed to Ebonyi State University and additional N200, million salary intervention fund totaling N500 million was released to assist in staff salary payment of the Ebonyi State University.” However, the state governor noted that the reduction of the school fees and other financial commitments to the university would affect some other government programmes like infrastructure development and provision of medical services in the state as they have become opportunity cost. He also enjoined the youths to start the process of registering themselves (200 per LGA) to benefit from the #EndSARS empowerment fund which will be launched in November 2020.
