Liverpool central defender Joe Gomez has been injured on international duty with England and is to have scan to determine the extent of the injury. The 23-year-old suffered the injury during the build-up to the game against the Republic of Ireland this evening. “I can’t tell you how serious it is as he’s yet to have scans,” said England manager Gareth Southgate last night. “What was upsetting was to see he was in a fair bit of pain. We’re hopeful for him that it’s not what it might be but it’s not a good situation.” A Liverpool statement said: “The defender will undergo further diagnosis on the issue with Liverpool’s medical team.” Liverpool already have Dutch centre-back Virgil van Dijk facing a lengthy spell on the sidelines. Van Dijk has had surgery on a knee ligament injury picked up against Everton in a 2-2 draw on 17 October. The Premier League champions have also been without Fabinho, who had been deputising in defence for Van Dijk, because of a hamstring injury. Additionally, Liverpool have an injury concern over right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold, who was taken off during a 1-1 draw against Manchester City on Sunday.
