By Onuminyu Innocent in Sokoto As a result of the recent #EndSARS protest that rocked the country, the Northern States Governors Forum (NSGF) has said that it will commission and bankroll a study by the Centre for Historical Documentation and Research, Arewa House, Kaduna, with a view to forestalling any future occurrence and mitigating the outcome, particularly in the northern region. Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal of Sokoto State disclosed this Saturday in Kaduna at the golden jubilee celebration of the establishment of the Arewa House which is affiliated to the Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria. A statement by the governor’s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Muhammadu Bello, on Sunday, said Tambuwal, who represented the Chairman of NSGF and Plateau State Governor, Simon Lalong, assured the Arewa House that its recommendations in the #EndSARS study would be implemented by the NSGF. He also said the Forum is also interested in commissioning another study on youths engagement and development with bias on job creation and entrepreneurship in northern Nigeria. He later explained why it became imperative to undertake the study during a stakeholders’ meetings with a cross section of Kaduna indigenes held at the Kaduna State University (KASU), noting that the lessons to be learnt from the fallout of the #EndSARS protest are many. “Economically, it runs into trillions of naira,” he stated, emphasizing that had that kind of mayhem happened in the north, the region might not have been able to cope with it as it “doesn’t have money for the reconstruction” that would have been required. Pointing out that it is in the collective interest of the north to reject any unrest or violence, Tambuwal, who was in company with his Ekiti, Jigawa and Kaduna State counterparts, urged all leaders in the region to be “accommodating and draw people closer”.
