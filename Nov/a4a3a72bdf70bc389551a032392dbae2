Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki is expected to speak on the prime place of integrity in society at this year’s Integrity Lecture and Award organised by Nigerian Association of Christian Journalists (NACJ). Obaseki will deliver his lecture on the theme, “Integrity Is Everything”. AIG Tunde Ogunsakin, Assistant Inspector General Police, retired, will be chairman of the occasion and Special Guest of Honour. The annual event is designed to discourage corruption and promote the spirit of integrity, according to a statement by the Secretary General, Charles Okhai. This year’s lecture and award, which is scheduled to hold at Sheraton Hotel, Abuja, comes in various categories and is strictly based on the leadership traits of recipients. The organisers said they chose to do this because “the developmental progress of any nation is intrinsically or directly connected to the level of integrity of her leaders. Our pre occupation as a group is to evolve a new face of leadership that is mentally integrity-conscious.” The prominent Nigerians who are deserving recipients this year include: Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State; Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu; Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State; Minister of State for Mines and Steel development, Dr. Uche Ogah; Speaker Cross Rivers State House of Assembly, Rt Williams Eteng; the Chief of Staff to Abia State Governor, Chisom Dike; Mr. John Oyekowa; Everest Okpara, among others. “Every recipient of the award is a symbol of integrity in our society today, and a Trophy of our contribution to the developmental progress of our nation, Nigeria,” the statement said.
