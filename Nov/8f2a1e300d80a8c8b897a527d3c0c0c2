After weeks of planning, all is now set for the 2020 Lagos Women Run tomorrow with elite category winner set to take home N1 million which is the highest in the history of the annual one-day event. The General Coordinator of the Lagos Women Run, Tayo Popoola, explained that the immense contributions of the Lagos State Government made it possible for the race to hold especially at a very difficult time of the country’s history. “We have made all arrangements to ensure a safe race on November 21, for both the virtual and elite races. “It’s the first time in Nigeria and indeed in Africa, so we want to make positive history that is why we have trained our Local Organising Committee (LOC), members to ensure all due diligence. “All Covid-19 protocols will be strictly observed and implemented, as the entire world is watching our progress on the virtual race,” she pointed out. Popoola stated that, organising committee has ensured that all virtual runners in the Open category understand the usage of the App which would monitor their races as they run anywhere in the country. “There will be a central leaders board to monitor the progress of the virtual runners and automatically pick the top winners. The virtual category has the open and the veteran categories as they run with different colours of numbers. The winners will also go home with cash prizes after a thorough check of the App.” The Technical Director of the Lagos Women Run, Yusuf Ali, said earlier during the week that the elite runners would be closely monitored to adhere with all the regulations especially as it was done at the London Marathon some months ago. “It’s the first time this will be happening in Africa and we are determined to make positive history,” Yusuf Ali said. He noted: “We are going to ensure that all the elite runners wear their face mask at the start point at the Tafawa Balewa Square, as the entire athletics world would be watching.”
