Martins Ifijeh in New Jersey, USA The United States President Donald Trump has accused the media of imposing Democrat Joe Biden on Americans as the 46 president–elect of the country. Biden won the election Saturday after polling 290 Electoral College votes as against Trump’s 214 votes. Results are still being counted from the three remaining states. Trump, who in a tweet Sunday evening described the media as ‘lamestream’, said: “Since when do the ‘lamestream’ media call who our next president will be? We have all learned a lot in the last two weeks.” It is over 24 hours since Biden won the mandatory 270 Electoral College vote needed to win the US presidential contest, and Trump is yet to concede defeat. It is unclear what his next line of action will be.
