emPawa Africa, the talent incubation initiative designed to nurture and support budding African talents, is expanding its reach to the northern region. Owned by Nigerian singer and entrepreneur Mr Eazi, the platform recently signed northern musicians DJ Abba and Namenj. Having started his musical career in 2011, Kaduna singer and rapper DJ Abba has grown to become one of the most sought after artistes in the Northern part of Nigeria with hit songs like ‘Su Baba Ne’ and ‘Yar Boko’. He won the Northern Nigeria Best Singer of the Year Award in 2019 and clinched multiple City People Music Award nominations for Best Rap Artiste of the Year, Best Kannywood Hip-Hop Artist of the Year and Arewa Artiste of the Year. Namenj, who lives a nomadic lifestyle across Jos, Maiduguri and Kano, stepped into the limelight with his Hausa cover of Adekunle Gold’s ‘Orente’ in 2015. Discovered by Mr Eazi through the emPawa30 Artiste Talent Programme, he released his debut single, ‘Rayuwata’ in July 2020 with the visuals directed by the prolific Adasa Cookey. He was featured in the ‘Nobody’ Hausa Remix by the award-winning disc jockey, DJ Neptune and is set to release a new song, ‘Fatana’, early next month. The signing of the northern artistes speak volumes of Mr Eazi’s commitment to discovering, raising and empowering African artistes. He is unrelenting in turning them to artist-preneurs as he continues his search for rare talents.
