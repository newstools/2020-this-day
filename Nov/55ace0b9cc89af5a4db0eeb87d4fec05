The 20-time Grand Slam champion will play Russian Daniil Medvedev in the semi-finals at the O2 Arena today. “I was playing, I think, a great level of tennis for almost two sets,” said Nadal, who hit 32 winners and made just 13 unforced errors. “The score was close, but in terms of feeling I felt that I was playing better than him. Then the situation changed. He won that game and then I was starting to suffer a little bit more with my serve. “But it’s always a good feeling when you are playing well and you’re playing against the best players of the world. You know you’re going to be in a tough fight. That’s what happened tonight. I was able to find a way to win. Very happy.”
