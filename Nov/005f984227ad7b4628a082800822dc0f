By Deji Elumoye The Senate Minority Caucus has commiserated with the government and people of Borno state over last weekend’s killing of 43 rice farmers by Boko Haram insurgents. The caucus in a statement on Monday by the Senate Minority Leader, Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe, while expressing deep sadness over the gruesome killings of the rice farmers by the insurgents said it was saddening that the harvest season had now been turned to mourning season. He said: “We are horrified that our people, particularly the farmers who are toiling tirelessly to sustain the nation’s food security has always become the target of the insurgents. “This is so horrendous and mind wrenching and of course the unmindful slaughter of our people in such dastardly manner is becoming way too many. It’s embarrassing to the country and calls to question the government’s strategy and capacity to tame the rising wave of insurgency and banditry ravaging a large swath of our dear nation, particularly in the Northern region”. The caucus urged the federal government to up the ante in the fight against the frightening insecurity occasioned by the resurging Boko Haram insurgents, banditry and kidnapping all over the country. It added that it is no longer enough for the Presidency to always issue tepid statements by condemning the attacks and daily killing of our citizens, saying now is the time to take decisive action and review its strategy since it seems the current one has failed woefully.
