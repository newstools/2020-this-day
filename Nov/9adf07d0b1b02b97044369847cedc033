In his judgment yesterday, Justice Ogundana said: “The law has prescribed mandatory punishment for the offence committed by the accused persons. “The court can nevertheless pass a less sentence having regard to the facts and circumstances of this case. “Accordingly, the two accused persons are hereby sentenced to death by hanging until they breathe the last, while on charges of conspiracy and burglary, you are sentenced to life imprisonment.” As contained in the charge sheet, the convicts were charged for conspiracy, armed robbery and burglary contrary to sections 403 (A),402(2)(a) and 411(1) of the Criminal Code, Cap.C16 Laws of Ekiti State of Nigeria, 2012. The act was committed on July 14, 2017, around 2 a.m. at Oke Ila area of Ado Ekiti when they were armed with guns and cutlasses to rob one Jimoh Folajoke Oluremi of her laptops, phones and Toyota Camry car. In her testimony before the court, the victim, Oluremi, said they were arrested through the efforts of police officers who tracked the phones, leading to the discovery of all other items robbed from her, including the car. To prove his case, the prosecutor, Mr. Wale Fapohunda, called four witnesses while there confessional statements were tendered as exhibits. Other exhibits such as laptop, phones and the car, had been released to the owner via court bond. The accused spoke in their defence through their counsel, Yinka Opaleke, and called no witness.
