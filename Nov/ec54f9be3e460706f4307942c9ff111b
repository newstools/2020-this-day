Blessed with soul touching vocals, King98 is a versatile artiste and is steadily marking his presence in the competitive music industry in Nigeria. He thought it pertinent to expand his music frontiers by coming to Nigeria to understand the music landscape and equally promote his music. He has worked with popular Nigerian artistes like Davido on ‘No Bad Vibes’ and Zlatan in ‘Pull-Up’. In his 2019 famous album ‘Francesca’, the artiste paraded a list of African music stars, including South African musician, Nasty C. In preparation for his forthcoming album set for release in March 2021, the music star is releasing a new single video ‘I Bet’ today, Friday, November 20. His determination of success has seen him record 16 songs within three weeks, according to reports. “I have been working, recording songs and one of the singles is already done with a video on it,” he said. The promising album is being recorded with several producers across the continent, including the award-winning Nigerian producer Speroach.
