A Chief Magistrates’ Court in Zone 6, Wuse, Abuja, yesterday convicted a member of the House of Representatives, Hon. Victor Mela, of lying on oath in his Form CF001 submitted to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as a candidate in the 2019 general elections. The chief magistrate convicted the lawmaker representing Billiri/Balanga Federal Constituency in Gombe State, in a case instituted against him by the police. The magistrate deferred the sentencing of the lawmaker. But reacting to the development in a tweet yesterday, Mela said he would immediately file an appeal against the court’s decision, adding that he would continue to keep his legislative seat and discharge his duties. He stated, “I would like to call on our friends, supporters and our sympathisers to remain calm as well as rest assured that I will challenge today’s perverse decision at the appellate court, immediately “In the same light, I will continue to discharge the functions of my office as the legislator representing the good people of Balanga/Billiri Federal Constituency, Gombe State. “The House of Representatives seat which I occupy today as a result of your trust and belief in me remains intact. Together we shall prevail! Thank you all!”
