•Says attack stalled palliatives distribution By Kasim Sumaina The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) has regretted the recent attacks on it warehouse by hoodlums in search of Covid-19 palliatives, noting the attack stalled relief materials distribution to victims of flood disaster across the country. The Director General, NEMA, AVM Muhammadu Muhammed (RTD), while speaking in Abuja, stated that now that normalcy was restored, the relief delivery had resumed in all states that were yet to benefits. Muhammed while highlighting the Agency’s Road Map to staff said although the delivery and distribution process was stalled, some states governments got their deliveries before the attacks. He noted that part of the target of the agency was the need to commence an awareness campaign to target 100 percent of Nigerians on reducing the risk of flooding and other disaster. He said that the agency activated the Emergency Operations Centers (EOCs) in 12 states faced with the challenge of the flood to properly coordinate and deploy relevant support for the affected persons. The NEMA boss further hinted that the agency must always respond to all catastrophic disasters in the country as well as mainstreaming and integrating disaster risk reduction within and across all sectors. Muhammed noted that part of his achievement since assumption of office was the reactivation of many operational equipment as well as making progress in procuring operational vehicles. He added that amongst other targets set by the agency was the promotion of mechanisms for disaster risk transfer and insurance, risk-sharing and retention especially in flood and fire disasters. “The agency’s communication equipment is receiving attention and the call center is been reactivated hence efforts were being made to bring home the Air Ambulance”, he said.
