Olawale Ajimotokan in Abuja The federal government has announced it is making effort towards reopening of Malam Aminu Kano Airport, Kano and Port Harcourt International Airport, Omagwa for international flights. The move to reopen the two airports was disclosed on Thursday by the Director General Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) Captain Musa Nuhu during the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 briefing. Nuhu said when the two airports recommence international flights, both Murtala Muhammed Airport, Lagos and the Nnamdi Azikiwe Airport, Abuja would be free of passenger pressure while passengers will find it more convenient getting to their destinations.
He said the Coalition Against COVID-19 (CACOVID) was also working round the corner to resolve the issue of ICT and Port Health services by getting adequate number of staff that will run the two airports 24 hours a day. He said once those two items were taken care of both Kano and Port Harcourt airport will resume operation.
