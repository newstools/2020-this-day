By Onuminya Innocent in Sokoto The Chairman, Senate Committee on Army, Senator Ali Ndume, has said that the Nigeria Army is underfunded. Ndume, who made the disclosure on Wednesday in Sokoto at the Nigeria Army 8 Divisional Headquarters, Kalambaina, during the committee’s oversight visit, added that they were at the army division so as to know whether the money appropriated for them is being judiciously used. According to him, the committee’s second mission is fact finding the various military operations going on in the North-west. “You aware that we have been briefed by the GOC and most of the information we shared are highly confidential,” he stated. He commended the division’s GOC, Brig. Gen. Aminu Bande, for waging war against kidnappers and bandits. “With what is obtainable in other countries in the world, budgeting one per cent to the Army in Nigeria is grossly inadequate,” Ndume said. Bande disclosed that apart from waging war against banditry, the Division has also lived up to its corporate social responsibility by providing healthcare service, potable water and palliatives to the host communities. “Comparatively, the security situation here is better than that of North-east,” he said. Earlier in a closed door meeting, the GOC briefed the committee on the activities of the Division ranging from different operation against kidnapping, banditry, health service delivery and provision of palliative to the host communities. The Nigeria Army 8 Division coordinates different operations in Sokoto, Kebbi and Zamfara States against kidnappers and bandits.
