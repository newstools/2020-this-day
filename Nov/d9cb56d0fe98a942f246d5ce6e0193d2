Nseobong Okon-Ekong A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Lagos State, Chief Willie Akinlude, has said that the postponement of the Lagos East Senatorial District and Lagos Constituency Kosofe 2 by-elections which were put off as a result of the #EndSARS campaigns, was a blessing in disguise for the party. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had scheduled all by-elections to hold across the country on October 31.
At a meeting with journalists in Lagos, Akinlude said the protests by angry Nigerian youths had reinforced the angst against the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). He said, “At both the federal and in Lagos State in particular, you could see that people have had enough of the bad governance and excuses by the APC government. It is providence that brought the #EndSARS protests. People now want a real change, not the kind of change the APC promised but things are still the same. In fact, things are worse. There is hunger and anger in the land.” Stating his conviction that the PDP will carry the day at the by-elections, Akinlude noted, “Everything is going in favour of the PDP.
Peoples eyes are open to the anti-people policies of the APC. In Lagos, they can see how one man has assumed the role of the Alpha and Omega, completely pocketing the state and dictating who gets what. This by-elections will be a pointer that the PDP is returning to power in 2023.”
Akinlude, a former Chairman of Mushin local government area in the Third Republic expressed optimism over the renewed capacity of the PDP in Lagos to take power. “We have welcome a lot of big names into the PDP in Lagos, like the Lagos East Senatorial candidate, Mr. Babatunde Gbadamosi. At the ward level, we are embarking on an aggressive membership drive, which has yielded very good results,” he said.
