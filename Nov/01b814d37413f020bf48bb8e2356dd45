Rebecca Ejifoma The operatives of the Lagos State Police Command have arrested 29-year-old Segun Titilayo, for allegedly killing and burying his girlfriend, Miss Oritoke Manni, aged 26, in Lekki area of the state. Segun is a resident of Otolu town, Lekki LCDA The State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Superintendent Muyiwa Adejobi, explained that the suspect, Segun, had made a call on October 13 this year by 11a.m. to the deceased to come to his house. Oritoke, who was a bar attendant at K.C Hotel, Apakin Town, Lekki, was said to have gone to Segun’s house. Adejobi said: “She could not be traced or seen afterward. Hence, the police recorded a case of missing person for the deceased. “However, on November 7 this year, one Mr. Adegbago David of the Adron Homes and Properties, reported to the Akodo Police Station, Lagos State, that a caterpillar exhumed a decomposing corpse while the company was excavating its site at Otolu Town.” The PPRO said police detectives immediately swung into action and the corpse was identified by the staff of the hotel to be Oritoke’s. He added that “the corpse was evacuated to a public morgue for autopsy.” He said that the police placed a manhunt on the suspect that led to Segun’s arrest. “He is being detained at the State Criminal Investigation Department (SCID) Panti and is giving useful information to help the police in its investigation,” Adedoji said. The State Commissioner of Police, Mr. Hakeem Odumosu, condemned the crime and directed the Deputy Commissioner of Police in Charge of the SCID, Mr. Yetunde Longe, to carry out thorough investigations on the matter.
