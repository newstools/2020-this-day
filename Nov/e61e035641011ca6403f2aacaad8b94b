According to him, this quarter has really shown the ability of Dangote Cement to meet the strong recovery of the cement market in Nigeria and pan-Africa after a challenging second quarter (Q2. “In Nigeria, we have witnessed a strong appetite for real estate investment and the recovery of infrastructure spending – including more concrete roads. Sales volumes in Nigeria were up 40 per cent in the quarter and pan-Africa reached a record high EBITDA margin of 24 per cent in the quarter,” he said. Puchercos said the company continued to focus on its export strategy and is on track to ensure West and Central Africa become cement and clinker independent, with Nigeria as the main supply hub. “Clinker exports have steadily been ramping up in Q3 after our maiden shipment in June 2020, whilst land exports have also resumed. Dangote Cement’s strategy to offer high quality products at competitive prices is meeting customers’ expectations in Nigeria and across the continent, where we continue to deploy excellent marketing initiatives and operational excellence across the continent. We remain committed to protecting our staff and communities by being fully compliant with health and safety measures in all our territories of operation.
