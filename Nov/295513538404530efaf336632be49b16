Mary Nnah Polo Avenue, Nigeria’s foremost luxury fashion destination, has received exclusive rights to retail Gucci Ready-to-Wear clothing in Nigeria. Polo Avenue has so far successfully established itself as the gatekeeper for luxury brands in West Africa. Italian luxury brand, Gucci, made its entry into the Nigerian market through collaboration with Polo Avenue in 2012. Since then, the brand has housed its exquisite accessories, shoes, and leather products at the flagship store, attracting clients seeking luxury fashion pieces in Africa. After years of partnership, Polo Avenue has now become an exclusive retailer for Gucci Ready-to-Wear pieces in West Africa, in addition to leather goods. This is in line with the brand’s commitment to providing beauty and customer delight, and connecting international fashion brands to Africa, using innovative global partnerships such as Gucci’s. Speaking about the partnership, Executive Director, Polo Avenue, Jennifer Obayuwana, said: “For many, Gucci is a way of life and a means of self-expression. Its high quality, attention-grabbing, luxury pieces always make a statement, which is why we ensured that we deepened our partnership with the brand to introduce its Ready-to-Wear pieces. “Our customers are promised beauty, delight, and an assurance of authenticity with each unique and opulent piece, and for these reasons, we are proud to be the true custodians of this luxury brand here in Nigeria. Gucci lives here at Polo Avenue.” Polo Avenue has also recently launched its second store in Lekki, Lagos, which presented the opportunity to extend her partnership with Gucci. The luxury fashion retailer launched in Nigeria in 2014 as a sister-company to Polo Luxury. In addition, Polo Avenue retails some of the world’s most prestigious fashion brands such as Bottega Veneta, Amina Muaddi, Berluti, Dolce & Gabbana, and Valentino, among others.
