Oluchi Chibuzor At least five micro and small businesses in the country will benefit from a $500 intervention fund set aside by Brisk Capital to boost their respective businesses. The need to support young SMEs businesses according to the firm becomes necessary in the wake COVID-19 and the recent looting occasioned by protest encountered in some parts of the country. Disclosing this to journalists in Lagos recently, the Chief Executive Officer, Brisk Capital, a financial management and investment banking organisation, Mr. Dominic Joshua, said small businesses in the country needed every live-support they could get to survive the recent crisis.
He also said the initiative was part of the investment efforts to help emerging businesses stay afloat in this trying moment of budding entrepreneurs in the country. He said he would give $100 each to five small businesses, while explaining that selection of the businesses would be at random as qualifying criterion was that they must have specific problems which to solve in the society. According to him, “Each of the businesses to qualify for this should be able to answer the question. Why does your small business need support? For the remaining part of the year, I would be committed to empowering five business owners with $100 each every Friday.” Joshua maintained that despite how tough the past couple of months in 2020 had been, small businesses kept pushing and therefore deserved to be supported.
“We are pushing this through a campaign of hash tagged #Fundsfriday, for small business owners to compete. From all the Fridays in November to December, 2020 winners will be selected,” he stated.
