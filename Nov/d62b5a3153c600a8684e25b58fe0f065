Erica Nlewedim, model and actress who was disqualified from Big Brother Naija Lockdown season is the new face of Legend Extra Stout and Star Radler. “I am delighted to represent these two exciting brands. They embody the youthful exuberance, unrestricted freedom of expression, among other qualities that make them a perfect fit for me and my audience. “This partnership will no doubt be a success, and I cannot wait to be part of the execution of some of the activities we have planned,” said Erica at a relaunch event held recently in Ikoyi, Lagos. Her appointment is coming on the heels of the relaunching of these two fast-selling products from Nigerian Breweries Plc. “As evidenced in the past, Nigerian Breweries is a champion of constant innovation in a bid to ensure the optimum satisfaction of our consumers and to make our brands refreshing and exciting. After a brief period of silence for both brands, we felt it was time to refresh them and re-introduce them to our loyal consumers,” remarked Portfolio Manager, National Premium Lager, Nigerian Breweries, Sarah Agha. Star Radler which originally had a blue, silver, yellow and gold wrap when it was introduced in 2014, now comes with a new yellow and blue wrap. The brand also comes with a new variant labelled ‘Red Fruit’, signalling the brand’s affinity for diverse offerings. Red Fruit is a cocktail of berries (red fruits) and the classic Lager, packaged with the remodelled bottle design and a touch of red replacing the silver colour for the ‘Citrus’ variant. Legend Extra Stout on the other hand swaps the old metallic label for a more modern design, featuring the signature Legend torch and a generous complement of the colour, black. The relaunch is in line with the company’s penchant for innovation in a bid to ensure optimum consumer satisfaction and to increase demand at wholesale, retail, and distributor level.
