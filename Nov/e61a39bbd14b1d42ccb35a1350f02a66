Laleye Dipo in Minna Niger state Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello has challenged states and federal lawmakers on the need to partner with governments for youth empowerment. Bello stated this in Minna on Saturday at the closing ceremony of a one-week training programme in various aspects of Information Communication Technology (ICT) for 140 youths, which was sponsored by the Senator representing Niger East Senatorial zone of the state, Sani Musa. The governor noted that the collaboration was necessary in view of the fact that government resources are very lean to carry out such programme alone, pointing out that the assistance will also check youth restiveness when the young ones are well trained and become self-employed. Bello who was represented by the state Commissioner for Investment, Mr. Mustapha Jubril commended Musa for his youth empowerment programme, which he said has been able to reduce the number of unemployed youths in the Senatorial zone. In his address Musa announced plans to open ICT centres in the nine local government areas that make up his constituency. “In no distant time, we are going to build ICT Centres in each of the nine local government areas. “We are also bringing modern rural markets to all the nine local government areas,” he said, adding that he will build 60 open shops with different designs in the markets. He argued that the nation has to match “what the advanced countries will use against us in the future which is ICT,” adding that “we have to start learning it today”. “With these efforts we also hope to re-engineer our economy and diversify the source of income of our people,” Musa said.
