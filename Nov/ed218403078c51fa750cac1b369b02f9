Emirates customers can now plan their travels and fly with greater assurance and peace of mind, with the airline’s latest initiative to provide expanded, multi-risk travel cover on top of its current COVID-19 cover. Provided by Emirates at no additional cost to its customers, in partnership with AIG Travel, the cover was designed to provide all Emirates passengers a truly unique offer for stress-free and hassle-free travel. Emirates explained that the new multi-risk travel insurance and COVID-19 cover would automatically apply to all Emirates tickets purchased from 1 December, and extends to Emirates codeshare flights operated by partner airlines, as long as the ticket number starts with 176. Emirates Chairman/Chief Executive, Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum said: “Emirates was the first airline to offer complimentary global COVID-19 cover for travelers back in July, and the response from our customers has been tremendously encouraging. “We’ve not rested on our laurels and instead continued to look at how we can offer our customers an even better proposition. We’re very pleased to be able to now provide this new multi-risk travel insurance and COVID-19 cover, which is another industry first, to all our customers. “We see a strong appetite for travel around the world, especially heading into the winter holidays as people seek warmer climates and family destinations like Dubai. By launching this new multi-risk travel insurance and COVID-19 cover, we aim to give our customers even more confidence in making their travel plans this winter and moving into 2021.”
