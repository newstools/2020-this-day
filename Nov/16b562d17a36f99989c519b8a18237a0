By Omon-Julius Onabu Following outcry of residents of areas devastated by floods in Delta State, the state Governor, Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, has released funds to the affected local government areas to cushion the effects of the ravaging floods, particularly to purchase food items for the affected communities. The Chairman, Delta State chapter of the Association of Local Governments of Nigeria (ALGON), Hon Itiako Ikpokpo, disclosed this in a statement yesterday in Asaba.

Already, the affected local government areas have started procurement of the food items, and will soon commence the distribution to the affected communities, he said, as he appealled to the flood victims to be patient as help was underway. Ikpokpo thanked governor on behalf of ALGON members in the state “for the gracious release of funds to procure food items for flood victims in the state” and appealed for patients and cooperation. “I therefore appeal to our people to remain calm and be patient as the various councils carry out the task of procuring and distributing the food items to the affected communities. “It is our firm commitment to ensure that no one suffers on account of flooding, as the government is prepared to meet them half way,” he said.
