Due to the ravaging effects of the COVID-19 and some other exogenous factors, Nigeria’s real GDP contracted for the second consecutive quarter by 3.62 per cent in the third quarter of the year, compared to a growth of -6.10 per cent, which showed that the country had entered its second economic recession in five years. One of the global rating agencies, Standard and Poor’s (S&P), recently predicted that the COVID-19 pandemic will significantly hurt banks in Nigeria and some other African countries.
It listed risks that banks on the continent would face to include the prolonged effect of the pandemic on their economies; the likely rise in debt, and a likelihood of default by debtors, among others. For Nigeria, it stated that the pace of recovery of the banking sector would be affected by the slow growth of the country’s GDP, depreciation of the local currency, and volatile oil prices.
It, however, noted that the pandemic has accelerated banks’ digitalisation and could trigger another round of restructuring and consolidation. “Short-term support to banks and borrowers leaves longer-term overhangs. The anticipated surge in leverage leads to higher corporate insolvencies. “The property sector is more severely hurt than expected. Ultralow interest rates are squeezing banks’ net interest margins, increasingly making weak profitability a structural problem for many banking sectors, particularly in Europe and Japan. “Banks need to take strategic measures as the pain will worsen. Those able to make structural changes, including cost-cutting and digitalisation, will suffer less,” S&P had stated.
