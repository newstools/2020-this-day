Anthony Joshua is looking “sensational” in the final weeks of training camp as he aims to “absolutely destroy” Kubrat Pulev, says promoter Eddie Hearn. Britain’s heavyweight star gave a glimpse of his destructive skills when Hearn visited Joshua’s headquarters in Sheffield on Wednesday, with his WBA, IBF and WBO title defence against Kubrat Pulev edging closer on December 12. Pulev has defeated Derek Chisora and Hughie Fury since his sole defeat against Wladimir Klitschko, back in 2014, but Hearn believes Joshua intends to inflict a crushing loss on his IBF mandatory challenger. “I went to see him yesterday, he looked absolutely sensational,” Hearn told Sky Sports.
“He’s moving so well. We know he’s brought in a couple of new trainers with Rob McCracken leading the way.
“He’s learning, he’s punching so hard, so sharp, so fast. I think this is going to be a tough fight against Kubrat Pulev. I also think he is going to absolutely destroy him. “I think he’s going to break him down, he’s going to dissect him, and he’s going to punish him. I think you’re going to see a statement. I don’t want to put too much pressure on him, but I really do. That’s what I think. “AJ will always be a relaxed, humble guy, but I really believe having seen the improvement that he’s made, the spite in his punches, I think you’re going to get a thrilling display from Anthony Joshua.” Joshua’s ultimate ambition remains an undisputed world title fight against WBC champion Tyson Fury, who this week abandoned plans for a homecoming clash with Agit Kabayel in December.
