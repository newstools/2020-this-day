Of all the video clips during this wahala, it was the one of former Governor of Cross River State, Mr. Donald Duke, that really caught my attention. He confronted some very angry people and engaged them. The fact that this would have been very impossible if locations were changed from Calabar to Orile or Mushin is not lost on me but the courage to leave the comfort of his home and the warm bosom of his very beautiful Onari to go try calm nerves must be commended. He apologized, he exhorted, he begged and he stated that all ex-governors would have to at some point apologize for the wrongs. This was my leader; I supported his run for the presidency even though I had said it was half-hearted but his presidency would have surely taken a different path from the taciturn and very detached one we are seeing now. Well done, Akpaneka. Blessing!
