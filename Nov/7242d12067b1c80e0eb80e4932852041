Federal High Court in Abuja on Tuesday, revoked the bail granted to Faisal Maina, the son of Abdulrasheed Maina, and ordered his arrest for jumping bail in his trial on money laundering charges. Justice Okon Abang also ordered that his trial on money laundering charges would proceed in absentia pending when the security agencies would be able to arrest and produce him in court. The judge also summoned his surety, a member of the House of Representatives, Sani Umar Dangaladima, representing the Kaura-Namoda Federal Constituency of Zamfara State, to appear in court to show cause why he should not forfeit the N60m bail bond which he signed for Faisal. The order for Faisal’s arrest came barely six days after the same court, on November 18, issued a similar order against his father, Abdulrasheed Maina, a former Chairman of the defunct Pension Reformed Task Team, who is facing separate N2.1bn money laundering charges before the court. Justice Okon Abang had on Monday, sent Maina’s surety, Senator Ali Ndume, to jail for his inability to produce the fleeing defendant in court. Following the judge’s November 18 ruling, Maina’s trial was held in his absence with three prosecution witnesses testifying behind him and his legal team. At the resumed hearing of Faisal’s trial on Tuesday, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission’s prosecution counsel, Mohammed Abubakar, said both the defendant and his surety had not attended court since June 24, 2020. Neither Faisal, his surety, nor his lawyer was present at today’s proceedings. Abubakar, therefore, applied for the revocation of his bail and his arrest citing section 184 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act.
