By James Sowole The Ondo State Security Network Agency better known as Amotekun Corps has handed over some suspected #ENDSARS looters to the Nigeria Police. It said the suspects involved in burning of police stations and looting of shops were arrested from different parts of the state. Military paraphernalia and motor-cycles carted away were recovered. Amotekun Head of Intelligence, Mr. Adebayo Ayeni, said the suspects have confessed to the crimes. Ayeni explained that the suspects were picked through its intelligence gathering network. Commander of Ondo Amotekun Corps, Chief Adetunji Olu-Adeleye, said efforts were on to arrest other looters and arsonists. One of the suspects, Mr. Oyewale Olayele, said he only picked some things from a police station and a high court already set ablaze with a view to selling them as scraps. Olayele stated that he didnâ€™t know it was an offence to pick things in troubled areas. He said the police cardigan he wore was picked up from a burning police station. Another suspect, Mr. Femi Ibine said the military paraphernalia found in his room belonged to his late grandmother who was a Colonel in the Nigeria Army. He claimed he joined others to fight a man who called him a thief.
