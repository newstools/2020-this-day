By Omololu Ogunmade President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday felicitated with his nephew, Malam Mamman Daura, on the occasion of his 81st birthday, describing him as “a dedicated public servant, consummate administrator and one of our worthiest gentlemen who is widely misunderstood by so many.” Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, in a statement, said Buhari noted that “Mamman Daura is a thoroughbred public administrator with an all-rounded knowledge and experience in life and government.” According to Buhari, “It’s impossible to sit down with Daura without gaining from his vast experience, knowledge and wisdom.” The president noted that “among Daura’s unappreciated virtues are his humility, compassion and zeal to provide mentoring to many who are privileged to be with him or close to him.” Buhari, who also described Daura as a veteran of Nigeria’s political history and an active participant in its development, said the revered journalist and public administrator is needlessly misunderstood. “Daura’s experience is not unusual because many great men are not appreciated, which stems from the cynical obsession of many of his critics,” the president said. He advised Nigerians to be just and fair-minded in the assessment of public figures like Daura whose contributions to the development of the country, he said, overshadow perceived flaws. Buhari said: “As you celebrate the ripe age of 81, may Allah bless you with better health and longer life in the service of Nigeria and mankind. You are a fountain of inspiration and an inexhaustible reservoir of knowledge. We are proud of your invaluable support. “I wish you more abundant blessings from God. Happy birthday.”
