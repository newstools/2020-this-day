By Deji Elumoye in Abuja The Ebonyi state Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) caucus in the National Assembly has
said that no member of the caucus is defecting to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).
Reacting to Tuesday’s defection of Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi state to the APC, the Caucus led by Senator Sam Egwu stated that the three Senators and five House of Representatives members remain card carrying members of the PDP.
Egwu emphasised that Umahi’s defection was not to the knowledge of Ebonyi federal legislators adding that “the Ebonyi governor is on his own on this matter and is the only person going to another party”. Details later..
