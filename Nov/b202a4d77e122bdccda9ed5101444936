Manchester City winger Ferran Torres scored his first career hat-trick as Spain inflicted Germany’s heaviest competitive defeat and joined France in the four-team Nations League finals. In a repeat of the Euro 2008 final, former Chelsea forward Alvaro Morata headed home Spain’s first goal, before Torres volleyed home emphatically. Rodri made it three with a guided header, and Torres slotted in a fourth before curling home the fifth. Mikel Oyarzabal’s tap-in made it 6-0. Spain and France will be joined by either Belgium or Denmark from Group A2 and Italy, the Netherlands or Poland from Group A1. It was a game that Spain dominated from the off – having 70% possession and 23 shots – but it was 20-year-old Torres who stole the show. His fast, intelligent movement and eye for a goal has impressed in the opening weeks of the season, and his performance here strengthened the idea that Manchester City may have got a bargain after only paying an initial £20m for his services. His raw pace and trickery set up an incorrectly disallowed Morata goal, before he showed composure to set himself and volley home his first. His second again demonstrated excellent temperament, as he controlled a cross that was behind him before slotting underneath Manuel Neuer. He saved the best for last as he superbly curled home from the edge of the area to take his international tally to four goals. His performance will have delighted fans in the blue half of Manchester, with the man he technically replaced at City, Leroy Sane, completely ineffective for the Germans
