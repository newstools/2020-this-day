The President, Sports Writers Association of Nigeria (SWAN), Sir Honour Sirawoo has commended the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) for the release of the FIFA Covid-19 Relief Fund. The NFF had released N11,400,000 as part of the Covid-19 Relief Fund from FIFA to SWAN. Sirawoo lauded the Amaju Pinnick-led NFF for the transparent way and manner it has disbursed the funds in accordance with the earlier breakdown and FIFA guidelines. According to him, “FIFA and the NFF must be commended for this transparent process. It has been done in such a manner that is open for all to see. “FIFA must also be commended for such a gesture despite a challenging period of coronavirus pandemic across the world. It is a sign of a responsive and responsible football governing body.” He assured stakeholders that the funds allocated to SWAN would be utilized transparently in accordance with the stated guidelines. “Let me state clearly that we will follow all guidelines as stated by FIFA and NFF; every penny expended would be published for all to see. “Our mantra has always been responsive leadership and we will demonstrate that in all our dealings. An enlarged NEC meeting will hold in a couple of days to determine how the funds will be utilized,” he stressed. Meanwhile, Sir Sirawoo has charged Nigeria’s representatives in CAF club competitions to make the nation proud by targeting the ultimate prizes.
