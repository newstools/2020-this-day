The Emir of Kano, Alhaji Aminu Ado Bayero, has attributed the success of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) to the quality of leadership the regulatory body enjoys. Speaking recently while receiving the Board of Commissioners of NCC, led by its chairman, Prof Adeolu Akande, the monarch also commended President Muhammadu Buhari for reappointing NCC’s Executive Vice Chairman, Prof. Umar Danbatta for another tenure of five years as NCC’s helmsman. “Indeed, the NCC has been playing a pivotal role in regulating and developing the telecommunications sector in the country, and this fact is well established and cannot be overemphasised. I therefore commend the leadership and pray for more successes for the Commission,” the Emir said. The Emir, who wished the board of the ommission a fruitful deliberation in its ongoing retreat in Kano, however, charged the members to come up with resolutions that would have profound impacts on Nigerian people. Earlier, Danbatta told the Emir that the board chose Kano again for its retreat because of the unmatched hospitality it received from the state during its previous retreat last year. He said the board found it necessary to pay the courtesy visit to the monarch and seek his blessing before the commencement of the retreat. “We had this retreat last year here in Kano and decided to come again. But as it’s the tradition, we cannot come to Kano without coming here to seek your permission and blessing in order to start the retreat. Your Highness, we feel we must come here and show respect because we hold this institution in highest esteem,” Danbatta said.
