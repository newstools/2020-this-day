Alexis Sanchez and Romelu Lukaku were both on target on Sunday as Inter Milan scored four times in the final 26 minutes to come from 2-0 down and beat Torino 4-2. Ex-West Ham forward Simone Zaza put Torino in front and Cristian Ansaldi scored from the spot to make it two with 62 minutes played. Inter were level within five minutes. First Sanchez scrambled home after Lukaku had struck the bar before the Chile forward’s cross gave his former Manchester United team-mate a tap-in. Lukaku converted from the penalty spot to put Inter ahead for the first time after 84 minutes and Lautaro Martínez added a late fourth. Inter sit fifth in Serie A, three points behind leaders Sassuolo.
