Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has announced his intention to repeal the Public Office Holder (Payment of Pension Law 2007), which provides for payment of pension and other entitlements to former elected governors and their deputies. The governor made this known on Tuesday while presenting the 2021 budget to the Lagos State House of Assembly. He said the bill for that purpose would be sent to the State Assembly. “Mr. Speaker and Honourable Members of the House, in light of keeping the costs of governance low and to signal selflessness in public service, we will be sending a draft executive bill to the House imminently for the repeal of the Public Office Holder (Payment of Pension Law 2007), which provides for payment of pension and other entitlements to former Governors and their Deputies,” Sanwo-Olu said.
