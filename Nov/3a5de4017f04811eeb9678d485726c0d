The Federal High Court in Abuja has ordered the National Caretaker Committee of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to stop the membership registration process it recently embarked upon until the case before him is resolved. Justice Taiwo Taiwo gave the order following a suit filed a former APC Youth Leader in Abia State, Kalu Kalu Agu. Agu had instituted the case against the composition of the Caretaker Committee after the NEC dissolution of the Comrade Adams Oshiomhole-led National Working Committee (NWC). The case has been adjourned till December 4, 2020. In line with his vision to expand the membership base of the party, Yobe State governor and Chairman of the APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Mai Mala Buni, last week, officially received materials for the party’s nationwide membership registration, update and revalidation exercise to be conducted across thirty-six states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). While taking delivery of the items for the exercise aimed at capturing a broad spectrum of APC members across urban, rural dwellers, the unlettered population as well as Diaspora, the Yobe state governor disclosed that the APC membership registration, update and revalidation exercise would be conducted across the country’s 119,973 Polling Units and 57, 000 Voting Points.
