By George Okoh The new Vice-Chancellor of Benue State University (BSU) Professor Joseph Tor Iorapuu has said his vision is to strategically reposition the institution, as well as change the attitude of Benue people towards the school. Iorapuu, who made the promise while speaking with journalists in Makurdi after assuming office as the sixth vice-chancellor of the university, also, pledged to ensure stability and enhance quality learning environment. He further promised to set up a centre of entrepreneurship to promote skills acquisition among students. “We want to produce students who can think strategically and not engage in bureaucracy. BSU is the heart and soul of Benue State and as such, all stakeholders must own it. “My approach and desires are to model the way by building on existing blocks, inspire shared leadership and vision, promote academic excellence, enable others to act through staff welfare and training and encourage the heart with the right attitude. These pillars will help us in achieving the objective of repositioning the university as a centre of innovation, knowledge creation, technology-enhanced enterprise driven, learning and adaption as core competences.” He appealed for cooperation from all stakeholders, students and the different unions including ASUU, SSANU, NASU, and NAAT to enable him succeed. He particularly called on all the unions at the national level to call off their strike in the interest of the students. Iorapuu succeeded Professor Msur Kambe whose tenure ran out recently.
