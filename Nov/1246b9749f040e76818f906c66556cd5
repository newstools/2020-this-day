By Oluchi Chibuzor BudgIT Foundation and Connected Development (CODE), two civic-tech non-governmental organisations have launched the COVID-19 Transparency and Accountability Project (CTAP). CTAP is an initiative that seeks to promote accountability and transparency through the tracking of COVID-19 intervention funds across seven African countries. According to a statement, both organisations would be leveraging their Tracka and Follow The Money platforms, as well as international chapters in other six focus African countries to activate a Pan-African tracking system for all COVID-19 funds received and donated to these countries. “Retrospectively, our experience with tracking COVID19 has shown a deeply rooted systemic profiteering culture, especially in an environment that lacks accountability and civic engagement,”BudgIT’s Director and Co-founder, Oluseun Onigbinde said. “We also observed that there is an increasing mistrust from citizens on the delivery of palliative care in Nigeria, Kenya and Liberia due to representatives who abuse the process and the absence of comprehensive citizen data” he added. CODE’s Founder and Chief Executive, Hamzat Lawal, stated that, “as nations of the world tackle the plague of coronavirus, with funding for African countries amassing in millions of dollars, it has become expedient to block financial leakages and ensure funds do not end up in personal pockets.” “With CTAP, BudgIT and CODE will advocate for accountability, transparency, and open governance while strengthening civic awareness and ensuring that targeted governments use COVID-19 intervention funds effectively. The project will address the threat of lack of accountability and the effects of COVID-19 on socio-economic development” Lawal added.
