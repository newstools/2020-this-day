Pirates boarded St Kitts flagged general cargo vessel MILAN (IMO 8113619) 14nm NNM near the Pennington Terminal in Nigeria while it was in transit from Escravos to Douala, Cameroon, and abducted 10 crew. Though the precise time of the attack was unknown, Dryad Global reported that the Automatic Identification System on the ship indicates that the vessel was in a southbound transit when she stopped on the evening of November 25. This is the sixth boarding incident (excluding Lagos) within Nigerian territorial waters in 2020. With the latest pirates attack, the total number of crew kidnapped from vessels operating in the Gulf of Guinea in 2020 has risen to 128 across 24 incidents.
