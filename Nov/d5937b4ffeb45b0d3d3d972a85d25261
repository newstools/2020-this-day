The President of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) Amaju Pinnick, has assured Nigerians that every effort has been made to advance the Super Falcons for future engagements. According to new Super Falcons Media Officer, Oluchi Tobe-Chukwu, the NFF President spoke on the team recently in Abuja when he paid a working visit to the Glass House, the new secretariat of the Nigeria Women’s Football League. “We have gotten a new coach for the senior women national team and there are new foreign-based Nigerian players who have declared their interests to play for the country. These are young and enterprising players for us to prove women’s AFCON is our birth right,” stressed the NFF Chief. He further explained that the NFF was working towards getting two international friendlies for the team to get them ready for the engagements. The NFF recently contracted American Coach, Randy Waldrum, to tinker the team to the next level after Thomas Dennerby unceremoniously walked out on the job. Randy is to be assisted by a former Super Falcons goalkeeper and Captain, Ann Chiejine and Wemimo Matthew.
