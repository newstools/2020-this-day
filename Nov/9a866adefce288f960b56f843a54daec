The United Arab Emirates (UAE) said yesterday that it would grant all doctors and infectious disease experts living in the country a 10-year visa, who are helping to combat the coronavirus pandemic. Foreigners in the UAE, like most Gulf countries, are generally only given limited residence visas tied to their current employment, and long-term residency is difficult to obtain. But to attract wealthy business people and highly skilled workers, the UAE last year launched the “Golden” 10-year visa programme, which is now being expanded. Those eligible include holders of doctorate degrees, medical doctors, and computer, electronics, programming, electrical and biotechnology engineers, tweeted Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al-Maktoum. “We are keen to embrace the talent that drives future development and this is only the beginning,” said Sheikh Mohammed, who is also the ruler of Dubai, which has the most diversified economy in the Gulf. Students from accredited universities who are getting top grades could also qualify, he said, along with those holding specialised degrees in artificial intelligence, big data and epidemiology. The scheme last year drew in some 6,800 investors, in a windfall worth $27 billion for the economy. Foreigners account for 90 per cent of the population of some 10 million in the oil-rich UAE, the Arab world’s second-largest economy. The country has so far recorded more than 150,000 cases of the coronavirus, including 530 deaths. A months-long lockdown and the impact on tourism and business has done serious damage to the economy, which was already slumping in recent years due to low oil prices. The “Golden Visa” was the first such scheme in the Gulf, which keeps tight control on residency. Similar programmes have been launched in other countries that seek to diversify their economies such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
