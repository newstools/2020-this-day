The Governor of Cross River State, Prof. Ben Ayade, has denied masterminding the arrest of a Catholic priest, Rev. Fr. Titus Armon. A statement by the governor’s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr. Christian Ita, read, “A lie remains a lie no matter who is telling it. The report making the rounds on the social media linking the state governor to the arrest of a Catholic priest of the Ogoja Diocese, Rev. Fr. Titus Armon, by the Nigerian Army, is a lie from the pit of hell. “First, the brother of the priest, a supposed critic of the Ayade administration, is someone that is not known to government. As such, his criticisms of the administration have gone unnoticed by government. “Second, Ayade only became aware of the arrest of the priest after a visit by four priests on the morning of Friday October 30, 2020 to plead for his release. They are Frs. Vincent Undie, Malachy Ephraim, Bob Etta and Julius Adah.”HE Governor of Cross River State, Prof. Ben Ayade, has denied masterminding the arrest of a Catholic priest, Rev. Fr.
