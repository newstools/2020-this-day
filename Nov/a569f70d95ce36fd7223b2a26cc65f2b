By Deji Elumoye A former Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Ike Ekweremadu, has described former President Goodluck Jonathan as an epitome of selfless leadership. Ekweremadu, in a tribute to the ex-president as he marks his 63rd birthday Friday, hailed Jonathan for his democratic temperament and selfless leadership. He commended the former president for not only the electoral reforms recorded under his administration, but also for providing the right democratic atmosphere to ensure that the reforms were implemented by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and other relevant agencies and stakeholders. “Jonathan’s democratic temperament was indeed a facilitator and great boost to the millage we covered in reforming the nation’s electoral system, especially in the 6th National Assembly. “Importantly, he equally provided the democratic atmosphere that allowed the INEC to be truly independent in managing elections and implementing the array of reforms under his administration without minding how it affected his party or his personal political aspirations,” the lawmaker, who chaired the Constitution Amendment Committee that piloted the electoral reforms, said. The Chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment also hailed Jonathan for his sense of justice, noting that history would continue to remember him as a president who saw the entire country as his constituency. According to him, “On His Excellency’s 63rd birthday, therefore, I salute him for his sense of justice, his sense of equity, and for being a true father of the whole nation, and a selfless leader, who placed the welfare, peace, and unity of the nation above his personal ambitions and interests.” The ranking senator prayed God to grant the ex-president more fruitful years and sound health to continue to contribute to the efforts to restore the nation to the pinnacle of glory.
