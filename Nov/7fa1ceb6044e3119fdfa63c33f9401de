By Francis Sardauna in Katsina The Nigerian Army has partnered with other security agencies in the country to completely eliminate the marauding bandits terrorizing farming communities in Katsina State and other states in the North-west region. The Deputy Chief of Defence Intelligence, Maj-Gen Gbolahan Oyefesobi, who revealed this to journalists at the Special Army Super Camp IV, said the synergy will eradicate banditry and kidnapping afflicting the North-west zone. He said: “Private individuals, civil society organizations, as well as non-governmental organizations also have roles to play; everyone has roles to play in addressing insecurity in the country. “We are working in synergy with other security agencies in joint meetings and assessments to see how to tackle banditry and kidnapping within the shortest time.” He stressed that tackling banditry and other heinous crimes orchestrated by bandits was not the responsibility of the military and paramilitary alone, hence the need for effective collaboration between security agencies and civil societies. Oyefesobi said: “Tackling banditry was not the responsibility of the military and paramilitary alone, also private individuals and non-governmental organizations have important roles to play. “The responsibility of fighting banditry and related criminality is not the responsibility of the military and paramilitary agencies alone, but that of all, requiring all hands on deck.” He, however, said the unflinching efforts and commitment of the troops of Operation Sahel Sanity have restored normalcy in farming communities hitherto captured by the bandits in the North-west region. Consequently, he said the anti-banditry troops will continue to dominate security-proven communities with confidence building patrols to ensure the sustainability of peace and development.
