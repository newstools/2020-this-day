We are committing resources to sectors that need to grow for our people to become self-reliant and economically empowered.” On the scrapping of pensions for former Governors, Sanwo-Olu said that “Mr. Speaker and Honourable Members of the House, in light of keeping the costs of governance low and to signal selflessness in public service, we will be sending a draft executive bill to the House imminently for the repeal of the Public Office Holder (Payment of Pension Law 2007), which provides for payment of pension and other entitlements to former Governors and their Deputies. “It is our firm belief that with dwindling revenues and the appurtenant inflationary growth rates, that we need to come up with innovative ways of keeping the costs of governance at a minimum while engendering a spirit of selflessness in public service.” In his address, the Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Mudashiru Obasa said the #EndSARS protests across the country had devastated the economy of the state hence the 2021 budget will focus on challenges of these events. Obasa stated that the devastating effects of the disruptions that followed the #EndSARS protests, in the state particularly were beyond imaginations. “The anarchy, burning, and looting of businesses have hit the economy and that it was evident that the rolethe social media played in all of these could not be overlooked,’’ he said.
