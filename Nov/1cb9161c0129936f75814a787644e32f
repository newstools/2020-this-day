Chinedu Eze The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) has arrested two Nigerians who came in from Sao Paulo, Brazil, with 16.65 kilogramme of substances suspected to be cocaine on their arrival at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA), Lagos. The two suspected traffickers, Okwubunne Chidiebere Simeon and Aniakor Uchenna James, were arrested on October 28, 2020, and were said to have concealed the drugs in a spectacular way to beat the officials of the NDLEA. The NDLEA Commander at the airport, Garba Ahmadu, in a statement, said the drugs were concealed in eight children duvet which contained seven absorbent towels soaked with cocaine while others were neatly and cleverly concealed in tin cans labeled ‘Schramn’. “If this quantum of drugs had penetrated into the society, we can only imagine the multiplier effect of crime rate in the country,” Ahmadu said. He said in the third quarter of this year, from July to September, the agency had arrested 12 suspected drug traffickers, which included seven males and five females, and a total of 15.800kg drugs seized, which included cannabis sativa, cocaine and methamphetamine. According to the NDLEA commander, “The involvement of people in drugs is condemnable considering the fact that drug intake is a catalyst that fuels crime. I want to call on well-meaning Nigerians to collaborate with us by exposing drugs barons. All information shared with us will always be treated with utmost confidentiality. The Command will remain focused on the drug war by intensifying efforts and exposing whatever modes of concealment used by the drug peddlers.”
