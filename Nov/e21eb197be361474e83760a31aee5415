The Lagos State Mobile Court has ordered the forfeiture of 31 vehicles to the state government over violation of a traffic rule. The drivers of the vehicle were arraigned by the Lagos State Environmental and Special Offences Unit (Task Force) on one count of driving against traffic. The offence was said to be punishable under Part (III) item 27 of the Lagos State Transport Sector Reformed Law of 2018. Following the plea of the drivers, the court ordered the forfeiture of their vehicles to the state government. The court also ordered 43 other drivers to pay various sums as fines to the state government for plying the BRT corridors and causing road obstruction. Speaking on the judgment, the Chairman of the agency, Mr. Olayinka Egbeyemi, noted that only 74 drivers appeared before the court out of the 160 traffic offenders arrested. Egbeyemi added that the agency acted in response to a series of complaints from members of the public, particularly motorists that activities of one-way drivers were causing gridlock daily since the #EndSARS protest across the state. “It is painful that with a high level of enlightenment campaigns and several warnings by the government, motorists, including private car owners, are still driving against traffic knowing full well that the penalty for such offence is outright forfeiture of the said vehicle to the government.”
