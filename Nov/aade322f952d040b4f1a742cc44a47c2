Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja The Governor of Yobe and the Chairman of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Committee of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr. Mai Mala Buni has said that he spends at least three days in a month in his state. The ruling party had during the emergency National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting held at the Presidential Villa on June 25, dissolved the Adams Oshiomhole-led National Working Committee (NWC) following protracted leadership crisis and set up a committee to manage the affairs of the party in the interim. The 13-member caretaker committee headed by Buni was given six months by the NEC presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari to manage the party. Within the six months, the committee was mandated to organise a national convention for new leaders to emerge and also mandated to reconcile aggrieved members ahead of the planned national convention of the party. But Buni, while reacting to criticism that he has been largely absent from the state since he took over as the caretaker chairman of APC during an interview with the BBC, insisted that he carries out his duties effectively even when he is not in the state. The Cable quoted the BBC as saying that the governor added that his duty in APC as the chairman of the committee was not hindering his efforts to discharge his responsibilities. Buni stated: “On the issue of staying, there is no way I can spend a month without spending three or four days in Yobe State. And then even if I return to Yobe, I won’t advertise or make it public that today I will be in Yobe and tomorrow I will be leaving,” the governor said. “Wait, Let me land, listen to me, I won’t be revealing to the public that I came to Yobe or when I am leaving. And at this age of technology, when will anybody say that there were bunch of files waiting for me? Even before I came here I don’t know the numbers (of files I treated).”
