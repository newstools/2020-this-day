Mary Nnah As part of plans to set an agenda for the incoming year, the Fountain of Hosanna Church of Christ has announced that her annual Convention tagged ‘‘MERCY” will hold from Monday, November 30th to Sunday, December 6th . The Church Convention which will take place at 10 Ajenifuja Street, off College Road, Haruna Bus Stop, Ifako-Ijaiye, Ogba, Lagos, will feature power-packed messages from renowned Ministers of God, Gospels artists and impactful initiatives. In a statement made available to the media, the Chairman of the Convention Committee, Pastor Olufemi Adeolu, stated that the theme for this year’s Convention was inspired by the Holy Spirit through the General Overseer of Fountain Hosanna Church of Christ, Prophet Kehinde Abiodun, and has a bearing in the book of Romans Chapter 9 verse 15. He stated that “16 years ago, God used Prophet Kehinde Abiodun to establish FHCC in order to deliver people from the power of darkness and prepare them for the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. We are also excited to let everyone know that the mercy of God makes all the difference and invite them to join us throughout the convention week”. There would be an array of deliverance ministrations by Anointed Ministers of God, live-changing initiatives and social intervention programmes such as empowerment sessions, Business Seminars, spiritual and career counselling sessions, free medical services covering free eye glasses among other free clinical tests.
