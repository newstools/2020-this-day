David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka The Commissioner for Health in Anambra State, Dr. Vincent Okpala, has warned indigenes of the state and Nigerians in general to be careful as there is a seeming resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic in the country. Okpala said the fear became stronger as more people are now showing signs of the disease, even as some patients have been found in school immediately after the #EndSARS protest, which he said exacerbated the spread of the disease. The commissioner, who spoke during an event put together to celebrate the second anniversary of a group, I-Witness Crew, a citizen journalism platform, insisted that the coronavirus found a means to spread further through the just concluded #EndSARS protest. According to him, “The #EndSARS protest was just a virus propagating and sustaining event. We must be very careful how we live. We must go back to all the COVID-19 protocols of social distancing, wearing of facemasks and washing our hands regularly. “In United State, we thought they were getting their hands on the matter already, until when the George Floyd murder happened, triggering the #BlackLivesMatter protests. Now, in Nigeria, we already thought we were getting better, until the #EndSARS protests also happened. “The protest has helped the virus to spread further, and states have started recording high numbers again. We (Anambra State) have remained relatively low, but other states have already started going high again in numbers. This virus seems to have found a way of spreading above all odds.” He, however, thanked the Convener of I-Witness Crew, Chidiebele Obika, for using the citizens journalism platform to correct a lot of fake information put in public space during the height of the coronavirus lockdown.
