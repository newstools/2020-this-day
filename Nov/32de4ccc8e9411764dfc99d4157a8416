By Omololu Ogunmade President Muhammadu Buhari Wednesday mourned former governor of old Kaduna State, Alhaji Balarabe Musa, who passed on this morning. Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, in a statement, said Buhari joined the government and people of Kaduna State to mourn the late former governor, whose passing, he said, would be sorely missed by all Nigerians who have diligently followed his antecedents as a voice for the voiceless. The statement said Buhari believed that Musa reflected the passion and vigour that heralded Nigeria’s independence, which he said steadily translated into activism for a return to democracy at the height of military interregnum. According to Shehu, the deceased remained steadfast in the call for good and inclusive governance, adding that as the former governor goes home, Buhari noted that he left a bold footprint on Nigeria’s democracy. Buhari added that Musa’s role in promoting good governance and development would always be remembered and appreciated by posterity, praying the Almighty God to grant his soul eternal rest, and comfort his family, friends and associates.
