FCM Travels Solutions Nigeria, a global provider of travel management services with presence in over 95 countries, has delighted children and employees of the Lions Village Motherless Babies Home, Lekki, Lagos with donations. The motherless babies’ home which is home to over 57 children was created to provide care and protection for abandoned, abused, orphaned, and homeless children recovered around Lagos State, Nigeria.
Speaking of FCM’s contribution to the orphanage home, the Head of Business, FCM Travel Solutions, Nigeria, Adejoju Sikuade noted that the donation was in commemoration of this year’s World Food Day and to as well celebrate this year’s World Children’s Day. “The year 2020 has been very eventful, the COVID-19 pandemic affected virtually every aspect of our lives and so we have decided to reach out to those who may have been negatively impacted by this,” Adejoju said. “Our visit to the Lions Village Motherless Baby Home is in commemoration of the World Food’s Day and the World Children’s Day which was celebrated recently. We are well aware that donations to orphanage homes and many other institutions that rely largely on support from the public may have dwindled drastically, hence, this has spurred us to action. Our donation is also a contribution to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 2 which is to achieve zero hunger by 2030,” Adejoju added. While thanking the FCM Travel Solutions Nigeria team for its kind gesture, Adebayo Funmilayo one of the Social Workers at the orphanage said, “on behalf of the management, staff, and children of the home, we use this medium to express our gratitude to you for your donation to the children.”
