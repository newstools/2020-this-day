By Michael Olugbode The federal government has so far released N5.2 billion to build houses for victims of Boko Haram insurgency in troubled Borno State, the state Governor, Prof. Babagana Zulum, has revealed. The governor, who spoke during an assessment tour of 1,000 housing units for returning internally displaced persons (IDPs) on the outskirts of Maiduguri, said the money released by the federal government is for the building of 10,000 houses for 1.7 million IDPs expected to return to their communities. The IDP returnees are currently taking refuge in IDP camps in Maiduguri, Dikwa, Monguno, Dolori and three border communities with Cameroon. Zulum said the release of funds was sequel to the state government’s request
last year for the construction of housing estates. The governor, while praising President Muhammadu Buhari for graciously approving the fund for the building of the housing units, said the houses on completion would ensure the resettling of 1.7 million IDPs to their ancestral
homes destroyed by insurgents. Zulum, while noting that the ongoing Dalori housing project was an intervention from the federal government, said: “Because of the integrity of this government, the federal government has directed the release of funds to the state government to undertake the housing projects.”
