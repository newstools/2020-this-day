The Director of the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), Mr. Sarki Auwalu, has been inducted as a fellow of the Nigerian Society of Chemical Engineers (NSChE). A statement from the Head of Public Affairs, DPR, Mr. Paul Osu, said Auwalu was elected into the NSChE fellowship at the 2020 virtual conference of the society which took place recently. The award, according to the society, was in recognition of a thoroughbred professional who has continued to be a game changer in the Nigerian oil and gas industry. Auwalu attended the prestigious Ahmadu Bello University (ABU) Zaria, where he bagged a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Chemical Engineering. He proceeded to Bayero University, Kano (BUK) where he earned a Post Graduate Degree in Management. His quest for knowledge took him further to Norway and USA where he acquired Diploma Certificates in risk assessment and Petroleum Policy and Management at PETRAD and offshore technology from Petroskills respectively. He has continued to shift the paradigm in the oil and gas industry regulatory space by developing initiatives and putting in place strategies that has now refocused DPR as a business enabler and opportunity house for investors and stakeholders.
