Four women, Maryam Usman, Safiya Bagobiri, Salamatu Hassan and Safiya Bagobiri were among those kidnapped with three other men – Yunusa Malam, Kabiru Shamuyanbu and Abdulkarim Musa. The bandits stormed the community on motorcycles and started shooting sporadically to create fears in the villages. According to the source, those kidnapped were ferried out of the villages on motorcycles. “The bandits drove into our villages and started shooting to scare our people. They kidnapped our people and fled with them to an unknown place on motorcycles. All efforts to get the reaction of the state Police Command through its Public Relations Officer, ASP Wasiu Abiodun, were abortive as he could not be reached on his phone. Meanwhile, just about 12 hours after the incident, seven other people were also kidnapped in Shamuyanbu village in Kusherki District of Rafi Local Government Area of the state. As at the time of publication, the bandits are yet to be traced while the families of those kidnapped have not also been contacted.
