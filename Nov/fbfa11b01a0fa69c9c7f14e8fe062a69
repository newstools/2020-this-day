In a couple of days, specifically December 4, billionaire businessman and Chairman, Doyin Group of Companies, Prince Samuel Adedoyin, will turn 85. The respected octogenarian had fortuitously been in public consciousness since 1968 when he established the octopus Doyin Group, which has now given him fame and wealth. When he was starting out some 52 years ago, after rising above the challenges posed by his humble beginning, he was not under the false impression that the business would fetch him instant wealth and fame. As a result, the Kwara State-born mogul, with a steely resolve, had seen every challenge in his way as an opportunity to look inwards in order to remain relevant. Today, he is not only relevant, but he can thump his chest as one of the very successful businessmen in Nigeria, on whom Providence has lavished its grace. His moniker, ‘Doyen of Industry,’ is a time-tested testimonial of his sterling feats as an industrialist of repute and an employer of labour. From manufacturing to real estate and from hospitality to energy, he has continued to give his far-flung customers and clients something to relish and even value for their money. Such is the life of this great philanthropist, who fancies spreading wealth in appreciation of God’s infinite mercies in his life. No wonder, when the birthday of a man with such phenomenal achievements and inspiring family approaches, not a few will want to share in his joy. But for the restrictions occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic, his family, friends and business associates would have made the coming birthday an event to talk about for a long time. In spite of this, a source revealed that the family would hold a thanksgiving service in church before retiring to his Victoria Island, Lagos residence, where he would play host to friends and business associates.
