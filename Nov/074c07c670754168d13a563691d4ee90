FBNQuest has introduced Children Educational Trust (CET) for children through a convenient and flexible plan.
The initiative is in line with the firm’s commitment to provide families the opportunity to secure the education of their children or wards. The current economic realities have placed tremendous pressure on many families, and FBNQuest offers a dependable plan for saving for post-primary and secondary education of loved ones. Speaking on the initiative, the Managing Director of FBNQuest Trustees, Adekunle Awojobi, said: “In spite of the recent economic slowdown, most parents will agree that the importance of education is non-negotiable. We are here to assist parents with designing a Trust Plan that will support the plans for their children or wards, while there are still here and after.” According to him, the CET from FBNQuest supports a long-term investment plan with the added benefit of an estate planning solution that excludes probate, unlike other education products. “In addition, the service is flexible and personalised, offering freedom that enables the settl or to pause or reduce contributions, or to transfer the benefits of the Trust arrangement to another beneficiary. The CET also comes with the additional benefit of a Trust Protector, who ensures that the Trust runs seamlessly in the event that the creator of the Trust arrangement becomes incapacitated or is unable to perform his/her role,” Awojobi said.
