Hadia Sirika, Minister of Aviation, has demonstrated that he is committed to changing the narratives in the nation’s aviation sector. Since his appointment, the Katsina State-born former senator has shown his patriotic fervour, particularly where foreign airlines and some countries have reportedly treated Nigerians very unfairly. It will be recalled that he was applauded for his decision to apply the principle of reciprocity to countries and airlines soon after the lockdown occasioned by COVID-19 pandemic was being eased globally to allow for resumption of international travels. He has also scored another plus for facilitating the waiver of customs duty on aircraft and spares, while also pushing for the unification of charges paid by domestic airlines. In the absence of a national carrier, which he has promised will be fully operational before 2023, he has directed that only Nigerian airlines should be engaged in the federal government’s evacuation of Nigerians stranded abroad. Little wonder, Nigerian-owned airlines are smiling again despite other challenges facing them. To boost civil aviation, he said 10 new airports would be constructed across Nigeria representing a 50 percent increase in the number of existing airports. For this and more, Sirika, a pilot, is touted as a blessing to the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration.
