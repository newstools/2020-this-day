Prospective farmers who desire to own farmlands now have an opportunity to do so, the management of Extralarge Farms Limited, which recently acquired 6,000 acres of land in Ogun State has said. The company said such farmers, who would be given various incentives, including training on how to grow and make money from organic agricultural products like plantain, cassava and rice, should visit its corporate office located in Lagos State or its website, for registration and other necessary information. According to a statement by Mrs. Abosede Oyibokure, one of the Xtralarge Farms’ governors, registered farmers would own a minimum of one plot and maximum of 12 plots. She said, “After four years of operating the farm, the farmer can either take over the land for further cultivation either by him/herself; or on his behalf by Xtralarge farms; and before the expiration of four years, he/she would be paid N90, 0000.00 per year for three years.” The statement noted that the overall objective of the firm, whose philosophy was hinged on integrity and transparency, was, “to raise new generations of passionate farmers.” Oyibokure added: “The investment is worth it because it offers you opportunities for self- employment, personal growth and poverty banishment.” She said “Buyers have nothing to worry about because the usual challenge posed by Omo Onile does not exist in our own case, while the entrepreneur would continue to smile to the banks through bountiful harvest and robust returns on investment.”
