MTN Nigeria has announced plan to launch ‘Zigi,’ an online assistant chatbot designed to enhance customers’ digital interactions with the brand, and provide speedy and secure marketing, sales and technical support. With this, customers would be able to interact with the chatbot on multiple channels including WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, the official MTN website and myMTN App. According to a statement from the telco, it would provide a wide range of services including account balance checks, airtime, data purchases and answers to frequently asked questions. The chatbot would also have the ability to transfer customers to a live agent.
These channels and varying features would be rolled out in phases as ‘Zigi’ continues to evolve to offer comprehensive support and services to all customers interested in interacting with MTN through ‘Zigi’. Commenting on the launch of ‘Zigi,’ the Chief Customer Relations Officer, MTN Nigeria, Ugonwa Nwoye, said, “Zigi offers personalised, intuitive and prompt service to our customers. “Her introduction would not take away the customers’ access to live agents but will serve as the first point of contact for customers who choose to interact with Zigi. “We believe that Zigi will ensure increased convenience which translates to better experiences for our customers, which is at the core of our purpose as a business,” the statement added. On his own part, the Chief Digital Officer, MTN, Srinivas Rao, said the launch of Zigi aligns with MTN’s digital transformation objectives. “We now live in a fast-paced digital age with new technological advancements driving the constantly changing landscape. This is why at MTN, we are determined to lead digital transformation which will provide easy-to-use connectivity solutions; improve customer experience and maintain the highest quality of service for everyone in our ecosystem,” he said.
