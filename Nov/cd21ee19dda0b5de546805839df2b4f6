Two first half goals and a third in the second half were all Akwa United needed yesterday to dispatch Cynosure FC in the ongoing 2nd Edition of Gov Wike Pre-Season Football Tournament in Port Harcourt. Despite starting brilliantly, Cynosure FC shot themselves in the legs when a poor clearance from goalkeeper Believe Imiete was punished by Ukeme Williams with a powerful shot in the 17th minute. Before the team could regroup, they were soon behind barely five minutes later when Ndifreke Effiong scored from a well weighted pass. Cynosure FC started second half with a determination not to be humbled by their more illustratious opponent and were rewarded when Anyanwu Daberechi scored a brilliant header off a corner kick. It was the first time Akwa United’s goalkeeper had faced a real threat for a long period. However, Ubong Friday scored a glorious goal to kill off any fighting spirit from Cynosure, who will now hope for a better outing in their next match. Akwa United’s coach, Kennedy Boboye said “it was a good game because we played against a team that is physical. We are here to prepare for the NPFLseason and not necessarily to win the tournament.” Cynosure FC Assistant Coach, Popola Joseph, while stressing that the encounter was a good one, quipped that “we prepared but in football, it’s either you win, draw or lose. The red card in the second half also pulled us back.” In the second match of the day, Abia Warriors and Bayelsa United played out a gruelling 1-1 draw. Anthony Okemirri scored from the spot in the first hall before Bayelsa United equalised with a brilliant goal in the second half.
