Victor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti The West African Examinations Council (WAEC), has apologised to the Ekiti State Government over the delay in the release of the 2020 results of public schools. The council debunked the rumour that the results, which were released on Thursday instead of Monday, was delayed owing to huge debt owed by the examination body by state government. There was palpable anxiety among parents and examination candidates in Ekiti, on Wednesday, over their inability to access their results via online platform provided by the WAEC, which fueled the insinuation that that state’s indebtedness to WAEC must have necessitated such. But in a letter dated November 5, 2020, and signed by the WAEC’s Branch Controller, Mr. Olajide Hakeem, for the Head of National Office, clarified that the government of Ekiti State was not in any way indebted to the council. The letter addressed to the Commissioner for Education, Dr. Olabimpe Aderiye, reads: “On behalf of the national office and the entire WAEC, I hereby tender our unreserved apology for the delay that occurred in the release of the Ekiti State public schools’ results. “The council wishes to state clearly that the Ekiti State was not in any way indebted to WAEC. However, it should be noted that many candidates from all parts of the country were unable to access their results throughout yesterday (Wednesday) due to the heavy traffic congestion on our side . The results were eventually accessed 5.45pm on Wednesday. “We condemn in its entirety any attempt by anybody or group making campaign of calumny to achieve any selfish desires on this very sensitive issue. “The Ekiti State government remains one of our very reliable clients and we cherish the cordial relationship existing between the state and the council, which we intend to keep. “We regret any inconvenience arising from the delay of results of the Ekiti State public schools. “Please, accept the warmest assurances of our highest regard.”
