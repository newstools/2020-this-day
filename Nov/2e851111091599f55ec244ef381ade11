Addressing journalists at the state police headquarters, the state Commissioner of Police, Johnson Kokumo said most of the escapee prisoners were re-arrested while committing other crimes. It was also was gathered that two of them were re-arrested in Ondo State and another in Lagos State. On the robbery suspects, Kokumo disclosed that some of the suspected robbers were among the robbery gangs that have been terrorising residents in Benin City. He said despite the outcome of the #EndSARS protests that led to the destruction of several police stations and carting away of arms and ammunition, the police did not fold its arms to watch the hoodlums have field day. “We are not folding our arms and watch the hoodlums have a field day. Our main concern now is geared towards re-arresting the escapees and recovering the looted and other illicit arms and ammunition in circulation. Kokumo said the exhibits recovered were two AK-47 rifles, four locally made guns, one Toyota Yaris Saloon car with Registration No. UBJ-447-SZ, one Toyota Highlander SUV Registration No. DGE-524-AH and 21 live cartridges He assured of adequate security during the Christmas period saying “as we approach the yuletide season, the Police will not rest on its oars until all the arms and ammunition carted away by the hoodlums are recovered and escapees are equally rearrested. The criminal elements themselves will not know peace.”
