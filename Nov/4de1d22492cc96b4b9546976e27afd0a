Ghana secured a comfortable 2-0 victory over Sudan in a 2022 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifier at the Cape Coast Stadium on Thursday evening. Victory moves the Black Stars six points clear atop Group C, while the Falcons of Jediane remain third on the standings. Ghana started the match brightly with the Ayew brothers, Andre and Jordan, combining well up front for the home side. The hosts carved out their first chance in the 13th minute as Andre Ayew cut in from the left before firing a dangerous ball across goal, and he was unlucky to watch his effort fly inches wide. However, the versatile attacker did get the goal he had been looking for five minutes later. The Black Stars captain beat Sudan goalkeeper Ali Abdallah Abu-Eshrein with a powerful shot from a free-kick to make it 1-0 to Ghana. Abu-Eshrein was then called into action in the 29th minute and he pulled off a great save to deny Samuel Owusu as the Black Stars looked to double their lead. Andre Ayew thought he had grabbed his brace on the stroke of halftime, but the goal was disallowed for a foul and the score subsequently remained 1-0 to the hosts as they headed for the tunnel at halftime. It was the Falcons of Jediane who saw most of the ball after the restart with Mohamed Al-Rasheed pulling the strings in midfield for the visitors. However, try as they might, Sudan were unable to beat Orlando Pirates goalkeeper Richard Ofori in the Ghana goal. The hosts doubled their lead with nine minutes left on the clock with what was a brilliant individual goal by Swansea City star Andre Ayew. The 30-year-old went on a solo run: beating two Sudan defenders before unleashing a thunderous shot which beat Abu-Eshrein hands down to make it 2-0 to Ghana. The two teams will meet in the reverse fixture on Tuesday.
