The National Insurance Commission (NAICOM) has received an honorary award for coordinating a N5 million insurance cover for frontline health workers during the COVID-19 lockdown period in April. The award was conferred on the commission by the National Association of Insurance and Pension Correspondents (NAIPCO) at its 2020 National Confab held in Lagos recently. Presenting the award at the conference, the Chairman of NAIPCA, Mr. Chuks Okonta, said the insurance package to the frontline health workers and the recognition of the insurersâ€™ efforts by President Muhammadu Buhari was a singular act that earned the insurance industry respect and commendation from both the government and the private sector.
