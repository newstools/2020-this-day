*Pepe sees red in Leeds, Arsenal draw Nigerian international, Alex Iwobi was in excellent form yesterday as Everton defeated Fulham 3-2 to return to winning ways. However, it was Dominic Calvert-Lewin who stole the show as he continued his excellent scoring form with two goals in an absorbing encounter with Fulham. Richarlison made an immediate impact on his return from a three-match suspension by providing the cross for Calvert-Lewin to bundle in after just 42 seconds. In a dramatic game, Bobby Decordova-Reid equalised for the hosts with a clean right-foot finish before England forward Calvert-Lewin went top of the Premier League scoring charts with his 10th of the season from Lucas Digne’s cross. France defender Digne provided another assist before half-time, this time for Abdoulaye Doucoure to head home unchallenged for Everton’s third – and his first since joining from Watford. Iwobi has struggled to nail down a regular slot in the side but was dynamic in south-west London. With Brazil forward Richarlison eager to make up for lost time in his first club game since 17 October and Digne providing a couple of quality assists, Everton dominated Fulham for long periods. In addition, Calvert-Lewin continues to impress and now has 15 goals in 16 appearances for club and country this season. Fulham missed their third penalty of the season, awarded for Ben Godfrey’s foul on Ruben Loftus-Cheek, when Ivan Cavaleiro slipped, hit the ball against his wrong foot and sent it over the bar. Elsewhere, Arsenal forward Nicolas Pepe was sent off for a headbutt as Leeds’ wasteful finishing cost them a Premier League victory. The game ended goalless. Marcelo Bielsa’s Leeds squandered a host of chances, both before and after Pepe was dismissed after video assistant referee consultation for sticking his head into Ezgjan Alioski’s face.
