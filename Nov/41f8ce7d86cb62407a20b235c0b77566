The new Captain of the Ilorin Golf Club, Chief Ray Okafor is quietly toeing the foot steps of former Governor of Kwara State, the late Muhammed Lawal in restructuring the club. To ensure Ilorin Golf Club keeps pace with front running clubs in Nigeria, Okafor all alone has constructed a Starter’s Tent, Bush Bar and two convenience gazebo within the vast fairways of the course so golfers don’t have to scamper back to the Clubhouse anytime they are pressed on the course. At the moment, the Captain who is into construction is planning to erect a 30-room Guest House around the Club House so golfers who visit can meet with available accommodation at relatively low cost. “I believe being a Captain is a call to serve”, Okafor said. “Before coming to this post, I already knew what I wanted to do. But when I came in, I saw there wasn’t the revenue to carry out my plans. I was not bothered and I opted to spend my own money just for the betterment of the Club. “I must say I was impressed at the way I was voted into office. The true spirit of one Nigeria came into play. Nobody cared I was Igbo. I got massive votes to the point that the votes of the three indigenes who ran with me combined could not match mine. This is why I plan to do so much more for this club,” he noted with satisfaction. Okafor who hails from Owerri did not begin to play golf early despite his 30 years stay in Ilorin. He was simply okay with regular squash games he was playing in the home of his bosom friend, the late General Tunde Idiagbon. But after the demise of the former number two citizen, he opted to begin to play golf in 2009. Ever since, he has not looked back.
