By Segun James As the probe into the shooting at the Lekki Toll Gate continues, the panel set up by the state government to look into the incident has been told by Mr Abayomi Omomuwa, managing director, Lekki Concession Company, operator of the tollgate, that he could not quantify the losses when the toll gate was occupied by #EndSARS protesters in October. Omomuwa also told the panel that contrary to insinuations, the toll gate was owned by private investors until 2014 when the Lagos State Government acquired it 100 per cent. Omomuwa who disclosed this while under cross-examination by a counsel for some #EndSARS protesters, Mr Adesina Ogunlana, said, “I believe that is the business of the company, not something to discuss in public.” When pressed further by Ogunlana, the LCC MD said, “It is obvious, when toll is not collected, revenue is lost.” But when pressed further by Ogunlana to say how much the company lost, Omomuwa replied, “I don’t know.” Asked if he reported the occupation of the toll gate by the #EndSARS protesters to the Lagos State Government, Omomuwa said he did not report to the Lagos State Government, he only reports to the LCC Board of Directors. He thereafter disclosed that the tollgate was 100 percent owned by the state government.
