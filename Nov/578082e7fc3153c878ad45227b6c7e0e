By Omololu Ogunmade The presidential panel assigned to probe allegations of corruption against the suspended Acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, (EFCC), Mr. Ibrahim Magu, is set to submit its report to President Muhammadu Buhari. Members of the panel chaired by a former President of the Appeal Court, Justice Ayo Salami, have arrived at the Presidential Villa with four boxes containing the report and exhibits. The panel which was inaugurated by President Muhammadu Buhari in July, was given 45 days to conduct its investigation and turn in its report. However, the panel later sought extension of the duration of its assignment following its inability to conclude its work within the period. The probe was the fallout of allegations of corruption and betrayal of trust levelled against Magu by the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami.
