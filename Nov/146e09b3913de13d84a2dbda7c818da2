As the 2020-21 UEFA Nations League continues this weekend, GOtv Jolli subscribers are promised live coverage of these matches on SuperSport, from 14 to 15 November 2020. The UEFA Nations League action gets underway today, as Spain visits the Netherlands for a clash against Switzerland by 8:45pm, live on SS Football (Channel 31). Spain tops Group A4 with seven points but their 13-game unbeaten competitive run ended last time with a shocking 1-0 defeat to an inexperienced Ukraine team. Switzerland are at the foot of Group A4 with two points, having recorded two impressive draws against Germany, but lost their remaining games. A defeat here would mean relegation to League B. Also today is Malta vs Andorra at 3:00pm on SS Football (Channel 31).
The Nations League continues Sunday with Denmark vs Iceland at 8:45pm on SS Football (Channel 31) and Czech Republic vs Israel at 8:45pm on SS Select 1(channel 34).
