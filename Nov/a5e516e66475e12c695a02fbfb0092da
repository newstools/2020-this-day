By Adedayo Akinwale The Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr. Yekini Nabena, has said that there was no court order restraining the ruling party from conducting membership registration. The ruling party stated categorically that the purported court order was erroneously reported and urged the general public to disregard it. Nabena in a statement issued yesterday said in respect of the suit: Kalu Kalu Agu Vs. APC & ORS, FHC/ABJ/CS/736/2020, a legal officer was sent to court on November 17, 2020 by the party to investigate the purported court order restraining the party, but found out that such order was not given by the court. He stated: “Upon our findings, we discovered that such court order was never granted by the court, as no application was made to the court to warrant the granting of such order. “The evidence from the records of proceedings of Monday, November 16, 2020 shows that no order restraining the party from conducting the membership registration was granted in respect of the above suit or any suit relating to the APC.” The party therefore called on teeming supporters, members and leaders to ignore the fake news and go about with their good work of repositioning the party
