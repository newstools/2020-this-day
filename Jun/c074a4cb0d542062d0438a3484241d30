By Ernest Chinwo Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike has said more companies are relocating to the state because of the attractive investment climate. He told journalists after an inspection tour of on-going projects in the state that a deliberate implementation of strategic policies has brought the investments. The governor stated that the improvement in the state’s security architecture with the help of security agencies and the provision of critical infrastructure are responsible for the turnaround. He also reiterated the resolve of his administration to return Port Harcourt to its garden city status. “I can tell you now that more companies are coming into the state. The security has also improved so much with the help of security agencies and people feel safer to invest in the state. “I am also resolved to leave Port Harcourt far better than what I met on ground. Everybody can see that it is not easy, considering the present economic situation in the country. “To sustain the execution of infrastructural development projects and also fight COVID-19 when most of my colleagues are complaining of paucity of funds shows political will and strategic leadership. “People are wondering how we are doing it. But we are determined not to disappoint our people and they will be happy when I have served out my tenure that they had a governor that really came to serve,” he said. The governor also announced that the contract for the expansion of Rumuola flyover project has been signed. He said work would soon begin on that flyover and the dualization of Ezimbu Link Road popularly called Mummy B Road and the Tombia Extension Road. Wike stated that the urban renewal programme of his administration is achieving its purpose particularly with the commitment shown by the contractors handling the three flyovers at Rebisi, Rumuogba and Okoro nu Odo.
