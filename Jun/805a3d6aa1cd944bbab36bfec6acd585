By Michael Olugbode The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) has taken relief materials to liberated communities on the Maiduguri-Damaturu highway. The three communities — Mainok, Jakana and Benesheik — all in Borno State, have at one time or the other fallen to attacks by Boko Haram insurgents. Speaking on Sunday during the presentation of the relief materials to the residents of the communities, NEMA Team Leader, Food Distribution to IDPs camps in Borno State, Flight Lieutenant Umar Sani, said the distribution was in continuation of the ongoing monthly sharing of relief materials to designated areas in the state. He said designated areas included 17 camps — seven official camps within Maiduguri, seven camps outside the state capital and three camps in liberated areas of Jakana, Mainok and Benesheik. He said the items were part of the federal government’s intervention to ease the hardship of IDPs displaced due to insurgency. Sani noted that the agency has so far covered 7,400 households in Bakasi camp, while 4,000 people have benefited from Teachers Village camp. He said other designated camps within Maiduguri were equally given before the distribution train moved to Mainok, Jakana and Benesheik. According to him, each household will get 25kg of beans, 12.5kg of rice, 12.5kg of maize and condiment that will last for one month. He said: “Every 30 days NEMA provide food items to displaced persons and every household gets in total 54.6kg of the items.” He however urged the IDPs not to sell the items provided to them as government would not condone such negative practice.
