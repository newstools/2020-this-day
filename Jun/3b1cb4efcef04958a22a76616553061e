By Vanessa Obioha Following the conclusion of the online auditions for the fifth season of the reality TV show, Big Brother Naija in May, the season will premiere on Sunday, July 19. MultiChoice Nigeria made the announcement in a statement but with a caveat. For the first time, customers will have the option to opt out from watching the show. DStv subscribers can send ‘BBNOUT [space] smart card number’ to 30333, while GOtv customers can do same by sending ‘BBNOUT [space] IUC number’ to 30333. Additionally, customers can activate the parental control option on their DStv and GOtv decoders for viewers younger than 18 years. With the prevalence of the Covid-19 pandemic, MultiChoice Nigeria has assured viewers that global best practices, precautions and preventive measures will be followed throughout the show. Since its return in 2017, Big Brother Naija has garnered popularity. Last year, the company revealed that it fetched over 240 million votes. For its fifth season, over 30,000 participated in the online audition. Though it is yet to give details of the prizes to be won, it assured viewers that this season’s jackpot, sponsored by Betway in association with Guinness, will be bigger. BBNaija season 5 will be broadcast live and 24/7 on DStv channel 198 and GOtv Max and Jolli packages on channel 29, with the live eviction shows and weekly highlights aired on Africa Magic Showcase, Africa Magic Urban and Africa Magic Family.
