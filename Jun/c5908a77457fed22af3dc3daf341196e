According to a statement, EY has set up the panel session, which promises to be very interactive, seasoned and high-profile Boardroom experts, including Chairman, MTN Nigeria, Ernest Ndukwe; Dean, Lagos Business School, Enase Okonedo; Chairman, Access Bank Plc, Dere Awosika; and Chairman, Kenya Airport Authority & NCRA Bank, Isaac Awuondo, among others, would focus on key areas including, managing business disruption-the role of the Board of Directors; leadership in uncertainty as well as building for long-term value. “Specifically, the speakers will be looking at how the COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally affected the way businesses operate. “Regardless of the business environment, the Board remains ultimately responsible for how companies respond to business disruption and given the events of the past three months, Boards must work proactively with management in ensuring business continuity,” it stated.
