By Olawale Ajimotokan The federal government has suspended the operation of the Executive Jet Services indefinitely for violation of the terms of approval granted it to operate a special charter flight from Lagos to Abuja and Abuja to Lagos on June 13. The Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika, announced the suspension on Monday at the Presidential Task Force on COVID -19 briefing in Abuja. He said the airline would also be fined heavily while the pilot that operated the controversial flight will also be sanctioned. Sirika said the airline operator was not given approval to fly artiste Naira Marley, who performed at a musical concert, organised by Jabi Lake Mall. Rather, he said that approval was only given for the flight to convey Justice Adegoke Okogie from Lagos to Abuja. It would be recalled that the FCT Mobile Court on Sunday shut down Jabi Lake Mall for two weeks for holding the concert in violation of the protocols on social distancing to control the spread of coronavirus. The closure followed the arrest of the organisers of the concert by the FCT Ministerial Enforcement Task Force on COVID-19 Restrictions.
