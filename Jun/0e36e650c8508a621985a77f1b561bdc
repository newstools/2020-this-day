Technology experts who spoke at the recent BusinessDay Digital Dialogue, have stressed the need for more investments in digital infrastructure in Nigeria. The dialogue, jointly organised by BusinessDay and Rack Centre, featured panellists such the CEO of Rack Centre, Ayotunde Coker; CEO of Venture Garden Group, Bunmi Akinyemiju; Vice President, Global Operations at Andela, Omowale David-Ashiru; and Country Manager of Google Nigeria, Juliet Ehimuah-Chiazor. Coker, who noted that building infrastructure was a long-term project, however said Nigeria had already started from a ‘good place’ with the existence of world-class data centres like Rack Centre. “People will see the high quality in digital infrastructure because of the realisation that digitalisation is important,” Coker said.
Akinyemiju said it would also depend on how the government responds with policies and regulations. Bold regulations that are forward-looking and progressive would show the extent of seriousness and how far the country would go in adapting to the new normal in the face of Covid-19 pandemic. Akinyemiju, also said the pandemic would likely accelerate the implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) and enhance collaboration across the African continent. Speaking about the opportunities that African countries could draw from the effect of Covid-19, Ehimuah-Chiazor said the virus that is ravaging the entire world, presents an opportunity for businesses to reset their models. “For businesses to successfully pivot to digital, leaders need to examine their business processes, customer engagement, supply chain management and employee engagement,” Ehimuah-Chiazor said. David-Ashiru said businesses that fail to adapt to the new normal could look forward to becoming part of another company in an acquisition spree that is imminent with post-COVID-19. “Post-COVID-19, there is going to be a lot of acquisitions of businesses that suffered during the crisis,” she said.
