The governor gave the directive to his cabinet members and aides in a statement signed by the Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Mr Donald Ojogo. Ojogo said: “Following constant exposure to visitors as well as the flurry of visitors arising from the pressure of official functions and responsibilities, Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, SAN decided to subject himself to COVID-19 test. “As you all know, the result has come out positive even as governor wasted no time disclosing his status.” He disclosed that the governor had resolved to self-isolate in line with global protocols for COVID-19, adding that it becomes necessary in order to ensure a proper determination and direction of focus. “Mr. Governor trusts in God that all will be well even as he seeks the prayers of all and sundry during this period. “It must be noted, however, that the decision by the governor to go into self isolation is voluntary and clearly depicts the need for transparency as we confront the COVID-19 pandemic. “Accordingly, there is nothing to fear; and no component of government business will be adversely affected within the period of the governor’s self-isolation. In this regard, Mr. Governor calls on all to be steadfast and remain committed to his or her assigned official responsibilities. “Specifically, Mr. Governor calls on his Campaign Team to continue with all planned events and itineraries as regards the Re-run Project. We shall win and win big, he assures,” Ojogo said.
