Delta Air Lines has announced that it will add 1,000 flights in July to boost its service and non-stop connectivity to popular summer destinations and major business markets. The airline noted that as economies reopen and border restrictions are lifted, Delta would add almost 1,000 flights system-wide in July, boosting service and non-stop connectivity to popular summer destinations and major business markets. Customers traveling or considering travel this summer can feel confident in a safe experience throughout the journey, from check-in to baggage claim. Delta has implemented several measures to encourage extra space and provide peace of mind at the airport, as well as committed to capping cabin seating at 60 per cent in main cabin, 50 per cent in first class as well as blocking middle seats through September 30, 2020. Pending a lift on border restrictions, Delta said it would resume service to customer favorite summer destinations – four-times weekly service from New York-JFK to Lisbon and daily service from JFK to Athens. Delta is also expanding its focus on hub-to-hub flying to coastal markets by adding four-times weekly service from Boston to Amsterdam and daily service from Seattle to Amsterdam. It also stated that connectivity within Africa would also expand, pending government approval, with the resumption of service from New York-JFK to Accra, as well as service from Atlanta to Lagos. “Confidence in a safe travel experience is key to a successful recovery,” Joe Esposito, Senior Vice President – Network Planning said.
