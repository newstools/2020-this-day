Ibrahim Shuaibu in Kano The Bayero University Kano (BUK) has terminated the services of more than 30 academic staff who were engaged on contract appointments in the university. Those affected by the termination of appointment include the Chief Imam of Kano, Professor Sani Zaharadeen; Professor Abdulkadir Dangambo of Department of Languages and many other senior lecturers. Their appointments, according to the university authorities, where terminated because the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS) would not accommodate contract staff. Dr. Sai’du Ahmad Dukawa, who is one of the affected lecturers, confirmed that his contract appointment has been terminated by the university. “The university informed me that the termination was in line with the federal government directive for staff to enroll on the new salary payment platform (IPPIS). “I have been on contract with the university for seven years. My contract is renewed every two years and is supposed to be renewed next year before it was terminated yesterday,” Dukawa said. The University Vice-Chancellor, Professor Muhammad Yahuza Bello, said the contract academic lecturers had 40 days’ notice before their appointments were terminated against 30 days’ notice as contained in the contract agreement. Bello said that the federal government made it clear that the university should pay contract lecturers from its internally generated revenue, which we could not afford. He said the termination of the contract staff would not affect the institution, which has 1, 776 academic staff.
