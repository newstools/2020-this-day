By Ndubuisi Francis The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has denied the purported resignation of its acting Director General (DG), Ms. Mary Uduk, from the Commission. In a statement issued Sunday by SEC’s Head, Corporate Communication, Efe Ebelo, the Commission said: “Its attention had been drawn to a publication in the media on Sunday, June 14, 2020, wherein the Acting Director General, Ms. Mary Uduk, is purported to have resigned from the Commission and a send forth party slated for Monday, June 15, 2020. “The Commission therefore wishes to inform the general public that the Acting Director General of the SEC has not resigned her appointment with the Commission, neither has she handed over to anyone. “Ms Uduk like every other staff of the Commission is awaiting the arrival of the new DG, Mr. Lamido Yuguda, who was cleared by the Senate last week.” According to the SEC, no send forth party is being planned for Uduk, adding that: “Stakeholders in the capital market and the general public are therefore advised to disregard the contents of the aforementioned publication as they are false.”
