Daji Sani in Yola The Adamawa State Police Command yesterday in Yola said it arrested a notorious kidnapping suspect, killed two members of his gang and recovered 15 cows, 171 sheep and 39 rounds of ammunition including one single barrel gun with 16 carriages. The command made the announcement on Friday in a statement signed by its public relation officer, Mr Sulaiman Nguroje, a deputy superintendent of police. The police, however, did not disclose the name of the arrested kidnapper. Nguroje said the success was recorded on June 4, 2020 following a distress call from one Yahaya Sale, a resident of Ganji Village in Gombi Local Government Area who told the police that he had received several calls from unknown persons threatening to kidnap and kill him if he did not pay a ransom. He said as soon as the police received the complaint, the command swung into action by deploying its anti-kidnap unit. He said the police were able to track the kidnappers by working with hunters. Nguroje further explained that fierce exchange of fire between the police and the suspected kidnappers led to the arrest of the gang’s kingpin while two of his members were shot dead and others escaped with gun wounds. According to him , the command also recovered one AK-47 rifle with 39 rounds of live ammunition, one single barrel gun with 16 cartridges,15 cows and 171 sheep. He said the state police command appreciated the support of members of the public while calling on anyone whose cattle were rustled to report to state CID Yola with evidence to claim them. ”Consequently, the commissioner of police Olugbenga Adeyanju, reassures of the command’s commitment in fighting all criminal activities, equally assured that the command under his watch will continue to make Adamawa State unbearable to the criminal elements until they repent or relocate from the state,” he said .
