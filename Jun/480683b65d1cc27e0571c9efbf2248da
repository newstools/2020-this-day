The Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN) has rescheduled its April diet examinations which was to take place from April 7th to 9th 2020. The exams are now to hold along with the October diet examinations. According to a statement signed by its Head Corporate Communication and External Relations, Mr. Nelson Olagundoye, the examination was rescheduled to ensure the safety of the students and other stakeholders that would participate in it. He also explained that, the decision to reschedule till October 2020, was in line with the uncertainty surrounding the full relaxation of the measures imposed by the federal and state governments to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. “The institute regrets the inconvenience caused to the candidates who had registered for the April 2020 Examinations and spent time preparing,” the statement explained. The institute had on March 21, 2020, indefinitely postponed the examinations as a result of the pandemic which forced the federal and state governments to introduce stringent measures such as social / physical distancing protocol, limitation of gatherings to a maximum of 20 people and total lockdown of economic and social activities. “By this decision, it means the Institute’s examinations will hold only once this year at a date tentatively fixed for October 6-8, October, 2020.
“All the students intending to write the examinations are encouraged to register on the institute’s website,” the statement added.
