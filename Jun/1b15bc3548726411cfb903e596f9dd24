The Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) has issued a red alert over an alleged discovery of substandard Toyota brand of engine oil in the Nigerian markets. Director General of the agency, Mr. Osita Aboloma said the suspected substandard engine oil was discovered through the SON regular market surveillance activity in its 42 state offices across the country. According to him, the imported product has neither undergone the SON offshore conformity assessment process nor was it registered with the organisation for traceability and quality verification. The DG added that the brand of engine oil was being sold in one litre and four litre containers to unsuspecting Nigerian consumers. In a statement, Aboloma further explained that substandard product had no close or remote relationship with the Toyota brands of automobile or the manufacturers. Also, commenting on the discovery, SON Director of Compliance, Mr. Obiora Manafa, advised members of the public to avoid patronage of the identifies engine oil in the meantime, stressing that SON operatives are on the trail of other uncertified and unregistered brands of engine oil in the Nigerian markets for necessary regulatory action. He stressed the need for Nigerians to patronise only certified made-in-Nigeria brands of engine oil with the MANCAP logo and imported brands that have undergone the SON offshore conformity assessment process and are duly registered for traceability and quality verification. The standards agency however, assured the Nigerian public that all purveyors of substandard and life threatening products would be prosecuted in line with the provisions of the SON Act 14 of 2015 and the criminal code once apprehended. It also frowned at the importation of poor quality products into the country to engage in unfair competition with high quality, certified, made-in- Nigeria brands.
