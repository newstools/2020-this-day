He stated: “We have reviewed the two reports, we note with satisfaction that all members of the screening committee were unanimous in their decision and also significantly members of the appeal committee were unanimous in their decision. “The appeal committee listened to the person who appealed before it and also reviewed the petition before them and they have reviewed everything and they arrived at the same conclusion.” Oshiomhole stressed the appeal committee enriched the report of the screening committee, adding that “the NWC unanimously approved the two committees.” In summary, he said the NWC had cleared three persons to contest the primary in Edo state, including Hon. Pius Odubu, Osaro Obazee and Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu. The chairman assured that the NWC would ensure a free, fair and transparent direct primary is conducted in Edo state come June 22.
