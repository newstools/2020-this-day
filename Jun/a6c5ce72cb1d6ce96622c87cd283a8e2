By Femi Solaja with agency report Nigerian midfielder, Wilfred Ndidi played all 90 minutes yesterday evening as Leicester City lost 1-0 to Chelsea in the English FA Cup clash at Foxes Stadium. Another Nigerian player, Kelechi Iheanacho was an unused sub as the former English Premier league champions crashed out of the oldest football competition in Europe. Chelsea edged out Leicester to reach their semi-finals of the FA Cup for the fifth time in nine seasons. Substitute Ross Barkley scored the only goal in the second half when he volleyed in from 12 yards out following Willian’s cross. The Blues had created the clearest chance of the first half but Christian Pulisic’s shot was superbly tipped over by Foxes goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel. Leicester’s best effort fell to Youri Tielemans, but his low strike was pushed wide by Willy Caballero. Chelsea, who have won the FA Cup eight times, join Manchester United and Arsenal in the final four. Newcastle played Manchester City late in the last quarter-final pairing of the evening
