By Rebecca Ejifoma The Inspector-General of Police Monitoring Unit in Lagos State has detained Instagram celebrity and Executive Director, Cubana Group, Pascal Okechukwu, popularly known as Cubana Chief Priest. Okechukwu, known for his lavish lifestyle, arrived at the Force Headquarters Annex, Lagos around 10am and was detained afterwards. The Instagram celebrity, it was learnt, was invited for alleged misuse of police escorts and weapons as well as unexplained wealth. A top police source said the investigation was sequel to an order from the office of the IG which expressed shock over the abuse of police personnel. He said: “We have detained Cubana Chief Priest and he is facing interrogation for misuse of police personnel as well as illegal use of weapon and his extravagant and unexplained lifestyle.” Cubana Chief Priest is known to post pictures of himself in private jets and exotic cars to impress his about 1.6 million followers on Instagram. Recalling a video he posted on January 6 this year where he was seen throwing freshly minted bundles of naira notes to a huge crowd, the officer said it is a crime that attracts a sentence of six months or a fine of N50,000 or both. This arrest, however, is coming a month after another Instagram celebrity and Chairman, Five Star Group, Emeka Okonkwo aka EMoney, was detained for abuse of police officers as escorts. Reacting to his arrest, the State Police Spokesman, DSP Elkana Bala, told THISDAY to contact the Force PRO since the arrest was made by the IGP Monitoring Unit.
