The presidency has said Nigeria would not take any retaliatory action against Ghana over the demolition of the Nigerian High Commission building in Accr. Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, said at the State House in Abuja yesterday that the presidency’s position was as a result of the apology tendered by the Ghanaian President, Nana Akufo-Addo, over the incident. “The President of Ghana has called and regretted the action and apologised to the President of Nigeria. I think he has shown leadership in the matter and what should Nigeria do; these are two leading countries in West Africa. “Nigeria will not engage in a street fight with Ghana. This cannot happen. So, the two leaders, especially President Muhammadu Buhari, who is much respected in Africa, they all call him ‘Baba’ (Father), so he is bound to show restraint”. The presidential spokes-person said diplomacy will be used in resolving the matter. “Matters such as this when they arise, it is always better when they arise, they should be resolved diplomatically. No, there shouldn’t be a fight between Nigeria and Ghana, this will not happen,” Shehu added.
