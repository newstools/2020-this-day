The National Coordinator Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, Dr Sani Aliyu, announced this on Monday at the daily press briefing of the task force. Briefing reporters on the approval of the extension of the Phase Two of the eased lockdown by another four weeks by President Muhammadu Buhari, with effect from Tuesday, June 30, Dr. Aliyu said government had approved “safe reopening of domestic aviation services as soon as practicable.” The nation’s airports were shut in March to curb the spread of coronavirus. In preparation for the resumption of domestic aviation services, the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) conducted flight simulation exercise at the Abuja Airport last week. Aliyu also said the PTF would maintain restriction on mass gathering and sporting activities while the movement across interstate boundaries would be allowed but only outside the nationwide curfew hours.
