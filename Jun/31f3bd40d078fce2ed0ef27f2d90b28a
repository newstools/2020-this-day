The Kano State Police Command has disclosed that it has arrested a man who allegedly raped 40 people within one town in the state. The spokesman of the command, Mr. Abdullahi Haruna, confirmed the arrest yesterday. “It is true. We have him in our custody. We are parading him soon,” he said. Haruna added that the suspect fled but was caught by neighbours who chased him after a woman caught him in her children’s room in Dangora town of Kano State. “People of Dangora are so happy at this time and we hope justice will be served appropriately,” a resident of the area said. The suspect had become very popular in the state and was known as “mai siket”, meaning “man in skirt”.
