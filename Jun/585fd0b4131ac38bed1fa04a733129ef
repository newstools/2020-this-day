It is expected that the company would repeat similar positive performance at the end of 2020 as it had assured of would not have any problem recapitalizing apart from embarking on other growth strategies. Already, it has able to recapitalise its subsidiaries: Mutual Benefits Niger; Mutual Benefits Liberia, Mutual Benefits Microfinance Bank and believe that Mutual Benefits Life and General Insurance will not be left out. Mutual Benefit Assurance has a five-year strategic plan set in 2017, which it said had achieved over 60 per cent implementation.
