Red Star Express Plc said it has been involved in the delivery of food items to several less-privileged communities in Lagos and Ogun. According to the company’s Group Managing Director, Dr. Sola Obabori, these efforts were made to support families and communities affected unfavorably by the COVID-19 pandemic. “Over the last few weeks, we have been working with some organisations to deliver food items. Some of these organisations include farm shops, religious organisations and non-profit organisations (NGOs). “For example, we have made a few deliveries for the United Way Greater Nigeria organisation. These organisations are keen to reach as many families and communities as possible to deliver food items that can provide relief in a tough time like this. We have been to various communities to deliver items like rice, beans, palm oil and groundnut oil,” he said. He commended the efforts of the organisations during the lockdown period and pledged that Red Star Express would continue to deploy its resources to ensure that more communities are reached. “As a company, we will continue to be involved with initiatives like this because we believe that it is our way of helping the families and communities affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We are grateful for such opportunities and we welcome more organisations that we can make similar deliveries for,” he added.
