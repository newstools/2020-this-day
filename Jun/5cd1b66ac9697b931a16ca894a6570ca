Onuminya Innocent in Sokoto The Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF) is poised to make the implementation of the financial autonomy of the legislature and judiciary across the country a possibility. This was disclosed yesterday by the Sokoto State Governor, Mr. Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, when he swore-in the new Grand Khadi of the Sokoto State Sharia Court of Appeal, Muhammad Tambari Usman, at Government House, Sokoto. Tambuwal, who is also the Vice Chairman of the NGF, said: “I assure you and the rest of Nigerians, who are having some concerns that governors are opposed to the financial autonomy of these institutions, that I am yet to see or come across that governor that is opposed to the independence of either the legislature or the judiciary.” He stated that he is personally in support of the process as a former legislator pointing out that “it is only a question of working on the framework because the Order 10 of Mr. President came up with a framework for the judiciary,” to the exclusion of all the state legislature. “And there were some states that were already having different frameworks. So, we need to harmonise and come up with a common framework that will work in the interest of these institutions,” he stated.
