Governor of Edo State, Mr Godwin Nogheghase Obaseki, graduated from the University of Ibadan where he studied Classics, the university’s authorities have confirmed. A statement by the Registrar of the University, Mrs Olubunmi O Faluyi, on Wednesday said Obaseki gained admission to the University in 1976 and graduated in 1979 with a Second Class Honours, Lower Division. The statement said records of his admission and graduation were intact in the archives of the university. Obaseki, who has been having a running battle with his predecessor and national chairman of All Progressives Congress, Adams Oshiomhole, is seeking reelection in the upcoming Edo governorship election but there are allegations bordering on the inconsistencies in his certificates, These have raised fears that there are moves to disqualify him by the APC, on which platform he is seeking reelection. One the alleged inconsistencies cited in Obaseki’s certificates was that his O/Level results showed that he had three credits but despite that, he spent only three years to bag a Bachelor of Arts degree in Classical Studies from the university without an A/Level result, whereas A/Levels are required for a three-year direct entry course in Nigerian universities.
