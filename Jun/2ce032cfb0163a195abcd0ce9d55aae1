England’s Jadon Sancho scored a hat-trick on his first start since the Bundesliga resumed as Borussia Dortmund thrashed bottom club Paderborn 6-1. After an uneventful first half, Thorgan Hazard put Dortmund ahead with a tap-in before Sancho slotted home his first goal since 29 February. Sancho added the third after Uwe Hunemeier’s penalty reduced the deficit before Achraf Hakimi and Marcel Schmelzer made it 5-1. Sancho got his third in stoppage time.
