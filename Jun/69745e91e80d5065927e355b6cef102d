By Adibe Emenyonu Nineteen days after he was abducted from his farm, the decomposing body of former Edo State Commissioner for Youths and Sports, Mr. Egbe Ediagbonya, has been recovered from a forest near his farm in Utese. Ediagbonya, who was also former Chairman of Ovia North East Local Government Area, was kidnapped in the early hours of May 16 in his Utese farm. His abductors initially asked for N15 million ransom and directed the family to drop N2 million in Patani, a border town between Delta State and Bayelsa State even though he was abducted in the border area between Edo State and Ondo State. Shortly after the family dropped the ransom, the abductors were said to have sent an SMS to the family that their father’s body was in a cassava farm near Utese where he was kidnapped. The Police Public Relations Officer in Edo State, DSP.
