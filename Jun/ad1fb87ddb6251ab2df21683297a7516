Former National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, has said he has accepted the dissolution of the party’s National Working Committee (NWC), which he led before his suspension, by the National Executive Committee in good faith.  Speaking Saturday during a live press conference monitored on ARISE TV,  the broadcast arm of THISDAY, Oshiomhole also said his confidence in President Muhammadu Buhari’s leadership remains unshaken.  The former party chairman said in line with President Buhari’s directive at the NEC meeting, held at the State House Thursday, to all members to withdraw all pending cases from the court, he had directed his lawyers to withdraw the suit challenging his suspension at the Supreme Court.  Oshiomhole said : “The APC under my leadership has done its best and the results are there. Of course we have now been dissolved and I have accepted the that dissolution in good fate.  “I am not going into the issue of legality or illegality, the bottom line is the President who invited me to lead the party and gave me all the support and even mobilised all the support across the country for my emergence as chairman also presided over the meeting where the NWC has now been dissolved.  “And because I have always assured the President of my loyalty, I know it is easy for people to speak of loyalty when the going is good, but loyalty is brought to the test when the going is getting really tough, so as a demonstration of that loyalty to Mr. President, the loyalty to our party, and loyalty to the Nigerian nation, I have decided to accept the decision in good faith.”  The party’s NEC had at a meeting chaired by President Buhari Thursday dissolved the Oshiomhole-led NWC following a protracted leadership crisis.  A 13-member Caretaker/Special National Convention Committee chaired by Yobe State Governor Mai Mala Buni was also constituted by the NEC.
