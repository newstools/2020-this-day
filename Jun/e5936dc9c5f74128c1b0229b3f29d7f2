*Rules out taking over Arsenal as Chairman Arsene Wenger is concerned about how Brexitcould change the reputation and stature of the Premier League worldwide. The former Arsenalmanager, 70, who now has a role at FIFA as their chief of global football development, believes the influx of foreign players in English football could be in doubt, depending on the terms of how the UK leaves the European Union. LaLiga, the Bundesliga and Serie Acould overtake the Premier League in commercial and economic terms if they are able to purchase the top foreign players, with the UK due to leave the EU at the end of 2021 – and Wenger is fascinated to see how it will play out. “Certainly, subconsciously maybe for some people, it [Brexit] was to regain some sovereignty of their own destiny. And football is completely the reverse,’ Wenger told UK’s The Mirroryesterday. “How will that change? That will depend now on how Brexit will be applied to football. “I’ve asked many people, nobody knows. Will people inside Europe be considered as foreign players who cannot play in the English Premier League? I don’t know.” As of now, it is unclear how or if Brexit will drastically change the accessibility of foreign players to play in the UK. Yet Wenger, who still lives in London, warned that with restrictive regulations on the movement of people, it could be a blow to the Premier League’s worldwide brand as the best league in the world. “But if the rules are restrictive, they will kill the superiority of the Premier League. “Because today the Premier League depends on worldwide exposure, with the best players and worldwide ownership with multi-billion owners from around the world.” Meanwhile, the 70-year-old ruled himself outof the running to become Arsenal chairman over the weekend.
