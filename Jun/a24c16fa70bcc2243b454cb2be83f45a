Liverpool ended 30 years wait for a top-flight title Thursday night after Manchester City lost 2-1 at Chelsea to confirm the Reds as Premier League champions. Jurgen Klopp’s side needed one victory to seal the league but City’s failure to win means they cannot be caught with their 86 points from 31 matches. The Reds are 23 points ahead of second placed Man City on 63 points. Only 21 points are now available to play for in the remaining seven match-days of the 2019/20 season earlier disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic. It is Liverpool’s 19th top-flight title and their first since 1989-90. But, despite waiting three months to celebrate this moment because of coronavirus, fans have been urged to “stay home” by the city’s metro mayor.
