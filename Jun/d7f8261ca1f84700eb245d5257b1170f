English Championship side Wigan Athletic have signed Leon Balogun on a permanent short-term contract till the end of the 2019/2020 season. Balogun, 31, joined Wigan on loan from Premier League side Brighton, where he struggled for game time following his free transfer from Germany. A long-term injury also did not help his cause at Brighton. The lack of playing time will cost him his place in the Super Eagles. This season, he has played six times for ‘The Latics’, who are 17th on the 24-team Championship table.
