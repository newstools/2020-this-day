Former Governor of Bayelsa State, Chief Henry Seriake Dickson, has commiserated with Oyo State Governor, Mr. Seyi Makinde and the Ajimobi family over the death of the former governor. The former governor who described Ajimobi’s death in a Lagos hospital on Thursday, as a shock said that he lived a life of service and commitment to humanity during his eventful 70-year mission on earth. He said in a statement by his Media Advisor, Mr. Fidelis Soriwei, yesterday, that Ajimobi would be remembered for his indelible contributions to national development. He said Ajimobi was a key player in the nation’s oil sector where he served as the Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of the National Oil and Chemical Marketing Company, Senator of the Federal Republic, the first two-term Governor of Oyo State and Acting National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress. The former governor prayed for the eternal repose of the soul of the late Ajimobi who he described as a nationalist whose standards were clearly above ethnic and religious differences. He described Ajimobi as an elder brother and friend who related freely and whose family was indeed close to his. Chief Dickson urged the wife, Mrs. Florence Ajimobi, the family and the Government and people of Oyo State to be consoled by the legacies of the former governor and quality of life he lived. He prayed to God to give the family the fortitude to bear the pains of this irreparable loss.
