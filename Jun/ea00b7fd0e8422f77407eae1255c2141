By Michael Olugbode Members of the Borno State House of Assembly have expressed delight at the performance of the state Governor, Prof. Babagana Zulum, in the first year in office. The lawmakers said they were amazed by the “countless projects” sited in their constituencies by the governor. The Speaker of the Assembly, Abdulkarim Lawan, made this assertion in a statement issued yesterday. Lawan, in the statement, said the Borno State Secretary to the Government (SSG), Usman Jidda, on Saturday unveiled 326 capital projects and 49 programmes and policies being executed by Zulum in one year. The speaker said in addition to passing 10 executive bills and appropriating funds for the governor, lawmakers had undertaken series of oversights in their respective constituencies in the state, and they were very impressed by Zulum’s countless projects. According to him, “As you know, it is our job as legislature to appropriate funds for the executive and to oversee them. After approving funds, our members have done oversights and have been visiting their constituencies. We are highly impressed by the countless projects across the state. Zulum’s performance is extraordinary.” Lawan explained in the statement that as part of their support, the state Assembly has since passed 10 bills brought by the governor which established new policies and institutions of government. “In the discharge of our duties and in support of Zulum-led executive, the state Assembly has passed bills which created the security trust fund, education trust fund, contributory health insurance scheme, the Geographic Information Services, sustainable development and humanitarian response agency, while also amended some laws on public procurement, the state university, polytechnic, road maintenance and state independent electoral commission, all of which helped in moving the state forward under Zulum’s sound leadership,” the Speaker said.
