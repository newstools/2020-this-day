Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja and Peter Uzoho in Lagos The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) said yesterday that it exported about $4.95 billion worth of oil and gas between March 2019 and March 2020. This was contained in the corporation’s Monthly Financial and Operations Report (MFOR) for March, 2020, which also announced a trading deficit of N9.53 billion, compared to February’s surplus of N3.95 billion. A statement by the corporation’s Group General Manager, Group Public Affairs Division, Dr. Kennie Obateru, in Abuja, noted that the NNPC has a total crude oil and gas export sale of $256.19 million in March 2020, which decreased by 30.89 per cent, compared to the previous month’s. “The March 2019 to March 2020 crude oil and gas transactions indicated that crude oil and gas worth $4.95 billion was exported.
“During the month under review, a trading deficit of N9.53 billion was announced for March 2020 compared to the N3.95 billion surplus posted in February 2020. “The over 300 per cent decline in March 2020 earnings was due primarily to the huge decrease of 181 per cent in the national oil company’s upstream subsidiary, Nigerian Petroleum Development Company’s (NPDC), due to the decline in crude oil prices precipitated by the coronavirus-induced global slowdown. “This led to reduced exports and dwindling world oil consumption; combined with deficits posted by the refineries, among others,” the report said. According to the NNPC, of the total sales, crude oil export contributed $184.59 million (72.05 per cent) of the dollar transactions compared with $281.14 million contribution in the previous month; while the export gas sales amounted to $71.60 million in the month.

On gas production, the NNPC explained that 218.37 billion Cubic Feet (BCF) of natural gas was produced in March 2020, translating to an average daily production of 7493.65 Million Standard Cubic Feet per Day (mmscfd). The release said 3,119.89BCF of gas was produced from March 2019 to March 2020, representing an average daily production of 7,912.05mmscfd during the period.
