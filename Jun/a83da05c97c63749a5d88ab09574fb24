Over 120 winners are expected to emerge at the end of the 5-day contest that kicked off on June 1, 2020, and ran till last Friday. According to a statement from the bank, the initiative underscores the bank’s belief in children.
“It connects with the Nigerian children’s aspirations and reinforces the importance of education as a vehicle to empower the child to succeed beyond their wildest dreams,” it added.
