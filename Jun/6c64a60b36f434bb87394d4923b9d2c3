Former Group Managing Directors of Odu’a Investment Company Limited, Chief Olu Mogaji, Chief Olufemi Adewumi and Dr. Adebayo Jimoh, have described as shocking and devastating the recent passing of Sir Remi Omotosho, a past GMD of the conglomerate. This was contained in a statement made available to THISDAY in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, by the three surviving erstwhile leaders of the group. Omotosho who died on June 5, 2020, had served as the sixth Group Managing Director of Odu’a Investment Co.Ltd from 1998 to 2004. According to the past GMDs, while serving the Odu’a, “Omotosho made considerably worthwhile contributions to the growth and development of the conglomerate, the collective patrimony of the Western States of Nigeria. “He had come to the Odu’a Group with a rich background in corporate business management; and he succeeded, in the short space of his directorship of the company, to improve on what he met on the ground in Odu’a. It is praiseworthy that his tenure remains a reference point for remarkable achievement in the group”. They also eulogised him as a man of many parts whose tenure witnessed significant human capital development. The statement read, “Recently, when the Board of Directors of Odu’a decided to constitute a body of Past Group Managing Directors, for purely advisory purposes, Sir Omotosho, as usual, played an exemplary role in the work of the Body. “Always a delight to listen to, Sir Omotosho, a very intelligent man for that matter, had a powerful debating skill to convey his views with cogent, logical points at every forum. He had a knack for details and ‘could sell snow to the Eskimos in winter. “Sir Omotosho was a grassroot man, not only in his home town, Aiyedun-Ekiti, Egbeoba, his Local Government Area, but also in Ekiti, his state of origin.
