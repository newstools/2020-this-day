By Vanessa Obioha Foremost beer brand, Star Lager, is known for its audacious feats and unique product launches. Despite the effect of the coronavirus pandemic that has restricted social gatherings, the brand from the stables of Nigerian Breweries Plc, threw all in the ring to give consumers a one-of-a-kind virtual party for the unveiling of a new 45cl bottle for Star Lite. The unveiling which happened over an hour long Instagram Live show, brought together fans to celebrate yet another milestone for the brand’s special offering. Themed ‘Enjoy Lighter Moments’, the launch gave consumers a good opportunity to connect with one another and share some of their own experiences where Star Lite had helped them relax and refresh without losing their cool. The launch was also filled with laughter and banter as On-air personality BigMoNaija hosted fellow OAP, Osama the Comedian, to a quick chat, where they bantered about some of their beer experiences while also sharing what they both expect from the new bottle size. “Lite is the new way of life, this 45cl Star Lite bottle is a reminder that less is better,” said BigMoNaija. However, the climax of the launch was the #LighterMoments after party, where DJ TTB of MTV Base thrilled the online audience to an exciting playlist that kept everyone entertained. First launched in 2014 under the Star portfolio, Star Lite made consumers the promise of a less filling feel beer, with a refreshing taste and less alcohol too. The brand quickly became a favourite especially among consumers who were looking for fewer calories, as the beer contains 100% natural ingredients. According to the Brand Manager for Star Lager Beer, Olaoluwa Babalola, “The new Star Lite 45 cl bottles are perfect for gradually easing into the fun, getting a refreshing buzz whenever you need it.” Both the new 45cl and the 60cl Star Lite beer bottles are now in stores.
