By Kayode Fasua The Ogun State Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, yesterday described as end of an era, the death of the former governor of Oyo State, Senator Abiola Ajimobi. Abiodun said the former governor died when his services were most needed and at a time his sagacity would have made a critical difference in statecraft and political engineering. While saying the loss was not only a loss to his immediate family and Oyo State that he governed for two unprecedented terms, Governor Abiodun noted, “It marked the end of an era for Nigeria because of the circumstances of the present time. “Senator Ajimobi was a phenomenal public servant and business entrepreneur. He broke the second term jinx in the governance of his state and had served at the Senate as a principal officer and Deputy Minority Whip creditably before attaining that height. “He impacted on both the lawmaking and executive arms in a matter that history cannot forget, “Abiodun remarked. He particularly recalled that at the twilight of Senator Ajimobi’s sojourn on earth, he had been touted as a possible Acting Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), because many believed in his ability to restore the party to its path of honour. “He had always creditably acquitted himself as a crisis manager and was a respected brands’ manager in the private sector. “Don’t forget that the late Ajimobi proved his mettle by getting to the peak of his career in the oil and gas sector. He was profound, diligent, resourceful and enthusiastic, and would be sorely missed. “Posterity will accord him his due recognition for his legacies of service and forthrightness. His unwavering support for causes he believed in was legendary and on a personal level, he was a confidant who threw his weight behind my bumpy journey to the office and in my previous efforts at seeking office as well as in business concerns,” Abiodun reminisced.
