Loud Whispers with Joseph Edgar The beautiful bird has stopped singing. She has slowly bowed her tender head and folded her wings. She very silently went to her creator is a soft smooth gale with trumpets chiming in harmonious tunes. Ituah’s canary sings no more. I saw Ituah on a video the very next morning officiating at the funeral of someone else and he made the statement that “I received a call at 2 am and my life crashed.” Our lives crashed collectively. Nigeria crashed. I don’t even know what is going on because as I write, I am hearing that Dan Forster and Senator ‘Pepper’ have also slept. God is in control.
