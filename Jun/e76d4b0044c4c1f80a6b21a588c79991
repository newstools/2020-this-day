By Adedayo Akinwale The All Progressives Congress (APC) has described the purported zoning arrangement for its planned National Convention which it said has gone viral on social media as fake. The Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the party, Mr. Yekini Nabena, in a statement issued Tuesday, therefore called on party members, supporters, stakeholders and indeed the general public to disregard the fake news. According to him, “If and when a zoning arrangement is made for the planned National Convention, it will be officially communicated and publicised.” Nabena said that the Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary National Convention Planning Committee at its inaugural meeting held at the APC National Secretariat on Monday did not discuss or issue the fake zoning arrangement for the planned National Convention. He recalled that the meeting unanimously adopted a six-point working document aimed at repositioning the party. Nebena noted that members also renewed their commitment to work as a family in the interest of the party and appealed to all leaders and members to give full cooperation to the committee in the discharge of its duties/mandate.
