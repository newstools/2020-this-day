Katsina State Governor, Aminu Masari, has directed the Army to finish off bandits killing innocent citizens, adding that none should be left alive in the forests of the frontline local governments in the state. Masari made the call during a sympathy and condolence visit to Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in Faskari, Kadisau, and Dandume Local Government Areas of the state. He said: “The bandits needed to be completely eliminated for peace to return to the land. ”The only language that the bandits understands was firing of AK 47 and therefore they will be treated with the language that they understands.” He assured about 4,000 IDPs located at Faskari primary school and about 800 IDPs in Dandume that the state government would continue to provide proper attention and care to them through provision of adequate food and medicaments throughout their stay in the camps. He maintained that as soon as military and police deployed to deal with the bandits were able to secure the forests, the IDPs will return to their houses to continue with their farming activities. While condemning the dastardly action of the bandits he assured that informants within the communities must be fished out to receive the same punishment with that of the bandits in the forests. Chairman of the State Action Committee on IDPs and Commissioner of Sports and Youths Development, Alhaji Sani Danlami, told the Governor the committee had been up and doing in the feeding and providing for the health care needs of the IDPs in the camps at Faskari and Dandume. He announced that some politicians have also been complementing the State Government towards the provision of food items for the IDPs. While at Faskari, the Head of Administration and Finance, Alhaji Lawal Ibrahim Danmummuni told the governor that the camp reached its climax after the Kadisau killing on April 9.
