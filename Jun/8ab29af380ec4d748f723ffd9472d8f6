Chelsea winger Pedro will join Serie A side Roma at the end of the season when his contract expires. The former Barcelona forward signed a short-term extension on Tuesday until the end of the season as his deal was going to expire at the end of the month. But Pedro had already agreed a deal in principle with Roma and was waiting for the Serie A club to reduce their wage bill to accommodate him. The 32-year-old will be available for all remaining Chelsea games in the 2019-20 season, in the Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League. Pedro was on the bench as Chelsea won their first Premier League match 2-1 following the restart at Aston Villa on Sunday. The winger won the Premier League during the 2016-17 campaign under Antonio Conte, the FA Cup in 2018 and the Europa League in 2019. The Spain international scored 43 goals in 201 games since joining Chelsea from Barcelona in 2015. Pedro signed for the Blues from Barcelona for a fee of £21million having won five league titles and three Champions League trophies during his time in Spain. The forward has played just 18 times since Frank Lampard became head coach last summer, but will hope to help Chelsea to secure a Champions League place for next season and lift the FA Cup again before he departs. Chelsea have already agreed deals to sign Ajax’s Hakim Ziyech and RB Leipzig’s Timo Werner at the end of the season – both players who can play out wide and will help to fill the gap left by Pedro. The Blues played Manchester City in the league last night and to play Leicester City in the FA Cup this weekend. Chelsea have also successfully managed to tie down forward Olivier Giroud and goalkeeper Willy Caballero on short-term arrangements until the end of the season. Chelsea’s final Premier League match of the season will be on July 26 but they could also be in the FA Cup final scheduled for August 1 before the Champions League resumes that month.
