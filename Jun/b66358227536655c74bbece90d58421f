By Hammed Shittu The Provost of Kwara State College of Education(CoED), Ilorin, Professor Yusuf AbdulRaheem, at the weekend hinted that the authorities of the institution have discovered about 2,000 fake National Certificate of Education (NCE) allegedly issued in the name of the institution. He, however, said some of the certificates were tendered as genuine in government agencies and establishments for employment. AbdulRaheem dropped the hint to journalists in Ilorin while speaking on the state of education in the country. He alleged that some staff members of the institution were responsible for the issuance of the counterfeit results. The provost stated that the college had detailed the Department of State Service (DSS) to trail one of the suspects, who he identified as a dismissed staff of the institution. He stated that the institution had requested the state Ministry of Education, State Universal Basic Education Board and the state Teaching Service Commission to undertake verification of their staff to ascertain the genuineness of the certificates being paraded. The don pointed out that the institution was able to fish out several fake certificates issued in its name during the revalidation exercise. According to him, “More than 2,000 fake results are outside which were given to students from this school. We went to SUBEB, Teaching Service Commission, and Ministry of Education and asked them to do a verification of results. “Many of them have come back and we have discovered that many of the results were fake. They were produced by our own people here. “Many of my staff members were taken to the DSS, as we don’t have problem with our lecturers. It is now left for those who are holding the certificates to own up. “But we thank God now that nobody can give assistance except it is within the confines of the law. Our lecturers are now going to their classes and the students are happy.”
