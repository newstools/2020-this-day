By Ibrahim Shuaibu in Kano Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, on Monday backed the decision of All Progressives Congress to disqualify Edo State Governor, Chief Godwin Obaseki, from the forthcoming governorship primary. Ganduje explained that what matters at the moment was the legal implications of the likely outcome of the exercise. The governor told reporters on Monday that the Bayelsa example where the party won a clean election but lost it to the opposition on point of legality at the law court was still fresh in the memory of members, adding that the party should not consciously walk into the same tight situation again. “As far as Edo is concerned, we are worried about the legality of our action. We believe the national headquarters of our party is doing all it takes to stay on the right course. “We are conscious of legal implications, we don’t want to overlook anything that will turn to be our albatross, the issue of Bayelsa state where we won an election and it was taken away is still fresh in our memory,” he said. Ganduje expressed optimism that no matter what happened, the All Progressive Congress would win Edo state again.
