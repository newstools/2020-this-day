The Nigerian Guild of Investigative Journalists (NGIJ), has dissolved members of its executive committee in a bid to reposition the group. The committee, which served in acting capacity for over a year, was dissolved during a virtual congress attended by over 40 members nationwide. The congress was chaired by Mr Israel Bolaji who nominated a 5-member electoral committee to conduct guild’s fresh elections to fill positions as provided for in its newly amended constitution. Members of the electoral committee are: Abiodun Abdulkareem of Focus TV, Rowland Olonishuwa of Herald Newspaper and Nkem Ifeoma. Other members are: Tope Sunday and Solanke Taiwo. The congress mandated the committee to work out modalities to ensure smooth conduct of guild’s election within a month. NGIJ is a registered association of journalists in Nigeria with special interest in Investigative Journalism. One of its flagship projects is the State Governance Assessment Report (GAR) which it conducted in Kogi and Bayelsa states respectively.
