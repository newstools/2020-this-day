By Ibrahim Shuaibu To further cushion the effect and hardship caused by lockdown which was occasioned by COVID-19 in Kano State, the state Governor, Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, has approved Mondays to be part of the days (Fridays, Sundays and Wednesdays) that lockdown is relaxed. Ganduje in a statement issued and signed by his Press Secretary, Mr Abba Anwar, yesterday, quoted the governor as saying: “While I urge the people to continue observing the COVID-19 protocols, I wish to convey to all that Monday is now the fourth day of the week that lockdown is suspended. People are now free to move freely on Mondays within the stipulated time, which is 6a.m. to 6p.m. “But they must maintain social distancing, wear their face masks, use hand sanitizer and wash the hands with soap and running water.” He directed that all markets and other public places in the state must continue to observe the protocols, as all hands must be on deck to effectively tame the pandemic.
