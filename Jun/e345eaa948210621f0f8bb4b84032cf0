The International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group, yesterday announced a $50 million loan to First City Monument Bank (FCMB) Limited to help it expand lending to small and medium enterprises (SMEs). This is to enable to small business operators sustain business activities disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. A statement from the bank explained that the loan, made through IFC’s COVID-19 fast-track financing support package, reflects the multilateral institution’s commitment to Nigeria’s private sector following the severe challenges brought by the health and economic crisis. The funds would allow FCMB to support hundreds of businesses with trade financing and working capital loans. Commenting on the development, FCMB’s Chief Executive, Adam Nuru, said, “IFC’s loan facility will allow us to keep credit flowing to SMEs as well as corporate companies across all sectors of Nigeria’s economy, including in the health, pharmaceutical, food and trading industries.” Also, IFC’s Country Manager for Nigeria, Eme Essien Lore, said, “Supporting financial institutions like FCMB is vital to keeping smaller businesses solvent, saving jobs, and limiting economic damage in the face of a challenge as formidable as COVID-19. Although Nigeria has a strong and dynamic private sector, it needs liquidity now to ensure it remains viable during and after COVID-19.” IFC’s $8 billion global COVID-19 fast track facility was launched in March 2020 to support existing clients through direct lending to affected companies and to financial institutions so they can continue lending to their clients and help to preserve and create jobs. With a network of 205 branches, FCMB serves more than 4.5 million customers in Nigeria.
