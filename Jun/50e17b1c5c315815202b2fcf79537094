Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has said that the Real Madrid Football Academy in the state would be completed in August to enable it start full academic activities in September this year. He said the new deadline is predicated on the fact that the contractors claimed to have lost 28 days because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Wike extended the completion date when he visited the project site of the Academy at the Yakubu Gowon Stadium in Elekahia, Port Harcourt, to inspect the extent of work done. Speaking to journalists, Wike said the academy would become operational in September when the new academic session begins.
He emphasised that the contractors would have no reason to delay completion of the project beyond August because the state government would fulfil its financial obligation. The Rivers State governor noted that the pitches and the administrative offices were ready but the academy cannot commence activities without the completion of the hostels and the classrooms that would be used by the students According to him, the aspect of academic activities is as important as the football training in order to give Rivers youths admitted into the institution a more holistic career path. He expressed satisfaction with the quality of work by the contractor and urged him to redouble his effort to meet the deadline. Speaking on behalf of the contracting firm, Mr. Julien Kan, Project Manager SPG Construction Nig Ltd, assured the governor that the project would be delivered on schedule.
