Today, the story of Nigeria’s politics will never be complete without a mention of his name. Indeed, without recourse to exaggeration, Senator Ike Ekweremadu, a former Deputy Senate President, is one experienced politician in history who has climbed every rung of the ladder to attain his current enviable height. He joined active politics in 1997, and his star has never suffered any eclipse since then.
The political gladiator, who attributes all to divine grace, is everything many aspiring politicians would wish to be in life. Providence, no doubt, has literally lavished its favour on him.
However, for a man who has everything at his beck and call, you wonder what else he wants in life. Society Watch gathered that the lawyer’s greatest desire is to secure the number one job of his state come 2023 when the incumbent governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, will have served his two terms in office. Interestingly, he is said to have received the blessings of many top political leaders as well as those that matter in the scheme of things across the state. It was gathered that he has been enjoying massive support owing to what his fans described as his great contributions to the growth of the state. ‘’Ekweremadu is so far the best candidate after Ugwuanyi, he has and built a solid political structure, with unmatched political clout and leverage as well as heavy financial war chest’’, the source said.
