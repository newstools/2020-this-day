President Muhammadu Buhari has rejoiced with Alhaja Sadiat Abeke Erogbogbo, a retired teacher and businesswoman who turns 90 June 7, 2020. He felicitates with the children, grandchildren and great grandchildren of the woman, who was known as ‘kind teacher’ in the early part of her professional life.
