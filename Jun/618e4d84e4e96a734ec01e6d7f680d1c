According to the Minister, ” Exactly a month ago this committee was set up, I thank you for keeping to the schedule of your mandate. We shall study your report, sit down with relevant agencies of government to examine the recomendations there-in. The Ministry is properly guided by Covid-19 protocol and will not shy away from taking decisions based on the reality on the ground.” Dare further said: “This is a milestone to determine when to start sporting activities, but we would not jeorpadise the health and wellbeing of our sportsmen and women.” The commiitee had made several recommendations which would be scrutinized before a final decision is taken on the hosting of the festival.
