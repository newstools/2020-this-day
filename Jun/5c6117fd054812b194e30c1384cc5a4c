Chuks Okocha in Abuja The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday queried the Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, over his apparent laidback attitude towards COVID-19 prevention and management protocols, resulting in the spread and avoidable deaths in the state. According to a statement issued by the National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, “Our party is deeply worried over alleged unreported cases of COVID-19 as well as issues of ‘silent deaths’ in the state, which have become scary.” The PDP noted that issue of unreported cases of COVID-19 in the state has put the citizens in fear especially as the governor’s administration has remained nonchalant and unresponsive on the matter. The party lamented that the state government has failed to engage in expected campaigns, public enlightenment as well as the establishment of adequate treatment facilities and protocols to guarantee public health and disease management, “while Bello continues to move on as if the lives of the Kogi people do not matter. “We note with pain the death of the Chief Judge of the state, Nasir Ajana, who had to be moved from Lokoja, the Kogi State capital, to an isolation facility in Abuja. “The situation in the state leaves no one in doubt that Governor Bello cares so little about the welfare of the people, particularly in the face of the deadly COVID-19 pandemic.” The party, therefore, urged the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to wade into the situation in the state, “as the government of the state has not demonstrated the required capacity to guarantee the health safety of the people in the state.”
