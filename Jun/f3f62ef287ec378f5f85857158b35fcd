Seriki Adinoyi in Jos A 300 level female student of Zoology department of the University of Jos, Plateau State, was last Tuesday night kidnapped after unknown gunmen attacked the Federal College of Land Resources Technology in Kuru, Jos. The victim identified as Helen was at home with other members of her family following closure of universities, and were preparing to go to bed when the assailants attacked their house at the staff quarters of the college at about 9p.m. A family source said the gunmen forcefully entered the house and beat up all members of the family with heavy sticks before abducting Helen to an unknown destination. “We were in our house when we heard knocks at our door. Five of us were in the house, including Helen. “We demanded to know who was at the door, but a stern voice replied and commanded us to open the door immediately, threatening to deal with us if we refused. They started shooting and before we knew it, they used a heavy object to force the door open and entered the
house. “They collected our phones and threatened to kill us if we cried out. “They then said they would go away with Helen. They also said that they won’t release her until we pay a ransom,” the source lamented. The state Police Public Relation Officer (PPRO), Mr. Gabriel Ubah Ogaba, could not be reached for confirmation as he did not answer the phone calls put across to him.
