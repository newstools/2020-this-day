By Deji Elumoye Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, has said there was never a time he requested for the probe of the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio.
Omo-Agege in a release on Sunday
denied asking the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to probe the Minister.
According to him, a letter purported to have emanated from the Clerk of the Senate, acting on his behalf and requesting the Chairman of the anti-graft agency, Mr Ibrahim Magu, to investigate the Minister did not come from him.
Describing the document as fake, the Deputy President of the Senate insisted that he never instructed the Clerk or any other person to contact the EFCC to investigate any individual.
The statement read inter alia: “The attention of the Office of the Deputy President of the Senate has been drawn to a letter dated 7th May, 2020, purportedly written by the Clerk of the Senate acting on behalf of the Office of Deputy President of the Senate requesting the Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to investigate and monitor the Honourable Minister of Niger Delta Affairs and one other.
“This Office hereby states that the said letter is false, fake, malicious, mischievous and vexatious. This Office never instructed the Clerk of the Senate, or in fact any person, to write to or contact the EFCC in relation to any person.
“In the light of the foregoing, we wish to urge the public to disregard the fake letter, same being the handiwork of a person or persons with criminal intents”.
