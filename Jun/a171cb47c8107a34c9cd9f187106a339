By Chuks Okocha The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) at the weekend described as outright lie by the Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, that some PDP governors are planning to defect to the ‘crisis-ridden’ All Progressives Congress (APC) as childish, laughable and pathetic. The party stated that such peddling of falsehood explains why nobody in Nigeria and beyond takes Bello seriously. The PDP lampooned the governor’s claim as a desperate attempt to divert public attention from the imminent mass exodus from the APC. The National Publicity Secretary of the party, Kola Ologbondiyan said Nigerians are aware that among the ranks of APC governors, Bello has no personal relationship with up to three of his colleagues, stating further that: “No APC governor is ready to associate with Bello openly. In other words, not up to three APC governors take him seriously.” Moreover, PDP said: “Governor Bello has no relationship of any sorts with any governor elected on the platform of the PDP. His current delusion on national television about PDP governors is driven by his usual character of engaging in petty lies.” PDP said it is however imperative to state that nobody abandons a cruising liner, which the PDP represents, to jump into a sinking ship like the APC. According to Ologbondiyan, “It is public knowledge that the APC is disoriented; having sleepless nights and holding endless meetings because they are losing members in droves to the PDP, as most of their key leaders are already on their way out ahead of the collapse of the APC. “Unfortunately, Governor Yahaya Bello knows that he has no space in any other political party. No party will accept him after the collapse of the APC. He will therefore not mind telling brazen lies to create the impressions that the APC is still breathing.”
