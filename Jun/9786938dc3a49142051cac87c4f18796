During this session, high level representatives from the African Union Commission, regional development banks, development financial institutions, international organisations and commercial banks from the continent, agreed to put in place the AUDA-NEPAD “100,000 MSMEs by 2021” programme. The AUDA-NEPAD MSME programme has will have five pillars: AUDA MSME Academy; MSME Financing Support Programme; MSME Marketplace; MSME Micro-health insurance Scheme, and MSME digital platform.
