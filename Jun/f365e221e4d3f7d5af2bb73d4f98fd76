Nigeria head coach Gernot Rohr says he rejected offers from Mali and Congo to sign a new deal with the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF). Rohr penned a two-year contract extension in May that will see the German finish as the longest-serving coach in Super Eagles history by the end of his tenure. The 66-year-old’s previous deal, which was extended ahead of the 2018 World Cup, was due to run out this month. Under the terms of the new deal, Rohr will be expected to spend the majority of the year living in Nigeria, take a pay cut, and be paid in local currency. Rohr previously managed the national teams of Gabon, Burkina Faso, and the Niger Republic before taking charge of the Super Eagles. “No, but they were a bit slow. President Pinnick and I wanted to meet in January, but I couldn’t,” Rohr told morgenweb.de.
“Then came the coronavirus and lockdown. Actually, we agreed, it was only about details. Finally, the sports minister also interfered. “I had requests from Congo and Mali, which I refused.”
Rohr was appointed Super Eagles head coach in August 2016.
