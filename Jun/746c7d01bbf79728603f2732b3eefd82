Ernest Chinwo in Port Harcourt The Rivers State Governor, Mr. Nyesom Wike, has directed that all staff of the Government House, Port Harcourt, should be tested for the COVID-19 pandemic disease. The governor also explained that the on-going increased testing of prospective COVID-19 patients in the state is a commitment to save more lives. Wike spoke yesterday when the Executive Director of BUA Foundation, Mr. Khalifa Rabiu, presented three ambulances to him at Gvernment House. His words: “The more we test, the more the number will increase and we are willing to continue to test. Let our people know that this is not the kind of sickness to be ashamed of. Nobody knows who you have shaken hands with. “I’m sure in Rivers State that we have lost not less than 38 lives on the record. Nobody will be happy that each day he wakes up, he will hear that somebody, probably a bread winner of the family, is no longer there because of COVID-19 pandemic. “In fact, I have given a directive that all staff of the Government House must go for testing. Nobody knows who is a carrier and we must save everybody as much as we can.” He noted the sustained support from BUA Foundation to the Rivers State Government, particularly at this period of COVID-19 pandemic. He asked companies operating in the state not to relent in supporting the state government because this is where they do their businesses. Rabiu expressed appreciation to Governor Wike for creating conducive business environment for their operations. He noted that BUA had donated N100 million and a lorry load of COVID-19 preventive items plus three ambulances that were presented yesterday. Rabiu said the donation was meant to show their support to the state government to enable it succeed in the fight against COVID-19. The State Commissioner for Health, Professor Princewill Chike, disclosed that 3,434 samples have been tested and the state treatment centre has successfully managed and discharged about 584 patients.
