By Segun James The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Lagos State has described the death of the senator representing Lagos East, Senator Bayo Osinowo, popularly known as Pepper, as shocking and a great loss to the party and the state. The party, in a statement signed by the state’s Publicity Secretary, Mr. Seye Oladejo, commiserated with the APC National Leader, Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Osinowo’s immediate family and the entire Lagos State APC on “this shocking loss”. According to the statement, “Senator Bayo Osinowo, it will be recalled, was in the forefront of the battle to entrench democratic governance. He was particularly a leading light in the struggle for the revalidation of June 12. He was a strong pillar and a stabilizing force as a long-serving member of the Lagos State House of Assembly. “Pepper, as he was widely known, will be remembered for his wise counsel, matured leadership, loyalty to the party and commitment to democratic ideals. May Almighty Allah repose his soul, forgive his sins and grant his numerous admirers the fortitude to bear this great loss.”
