By Adedayo Akinwale The federal government has reassured Nigerians of its total commitment to put an end to banditry and other forms of criminal activities across the country. The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Zubairu Dada, made this known while speaking in Minna, Niger State. In a statement issued on Sunday by his Special Adviser on Media, Ibrahim Aliyu, Dada expressed regret over the increased activities of bandits in some states across the country, including Niger State. According to him, “The federal government is committed to ending banditry and all forms of criminality in the country. President Muhammadu Buhari is intensifying efforts to curb the menace.” The minister noted that it was based on this that the president met with the service chiefs and other relevant stakeholders last week to find a lasting solution and stop further escalation of the situation. On the federal government’s efforts in the provision of social amenities to all parts of the country, Dada explained that the federal government has embarked on various projects that would be beneficial to the people, as part of its plans to reduce the infrastructural deficit facing the country. He mentioned the taken over of the Zungeru-Wushishi Water Works Project by the federal government, adding that when completed, it would provide the two towns not only potable drinking water, but also boost dry season farming in the area. The minister said in terms of road projects, Niger State had also benefitted as the federal government had awarded contract for the construction and reconstruction of major roads in the state such as the Lambata-Minna road, Kontagora-Mokwa road, Kontagora-Yauri road, which was already completed and the Lapai- Nupeko-Sachi road, among others.
