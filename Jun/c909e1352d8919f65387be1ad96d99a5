The Association of Telecommunications Companies of Nigeria (ATCON), will today, host a virtual conversation to discuss the Socio-economic and Political Impact of COVID-19 on Telecom and ICT Sector in Nigeria, via Zoom. President of ATCON, Mr. Olusola Teniola, said: “COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the normal ways of living and transacting business socially, economically and politically, which has now made us to realise that Nigeria cannot continue to rely on its traditional means of livelihood which is revenue from the sale of the volatile crude oil. For example, the price of crude oil in the international market fell below the benchmark prize used for 2020 budget and the federal government has resorted to borrowing a huge sum of money from the IMF to cushion the effect of the fall in the price of crude oil in the international market. To salvage the situation, there is an urgent need for collaboration from both the public and private sector to jumpstart the diversification and emergence of digitization of the Nigerian economy.” Teniola said the objectives of the virtual meeting would be to ensure effective regulation and development and building of local capacities for the speedy spread of telecom and ICT infrastructure facilities across the country, as well as to push for the buy-in of governments at all levels to encourage telecom and ICT infrastructure development in their respective states by encouraging rapid investment through incentives such as tax holiday and provision of special intervention funds for the sector by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). This high-powered virtual meeting is expected to be attended by top government functionaries, CEOs of Telecom and ICT Companies, Directors of Public and Private Sector Organisations and the media.
