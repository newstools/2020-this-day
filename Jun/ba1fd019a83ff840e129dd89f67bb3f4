Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja The House of Representatives has called on the Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs to direct Setraco Construction Company and other contractors handling the East-West road to immediately return to site. It also called on the ministry and Setraco to rehabilitate the most threatened sections in Rivers/Bayelsa and Bayelsa/Delta axis immediately to avoid cutting off these sections on the road. The House, therefore, urged the federal government to redeem all liabilities owed contractors constructing the road. It urged “the federal government and the Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs to complete this important economic road without any further delay.” The resolution of the House followed the adoption of a motion on the need to immediately repair the failing sections of the road, particularly the Bayelsa/Rivers and Bayelsa/Delta axis, and complete the construction of the road, moved by Hon. Steve Azaiki. Moving the motion, Azaiki said the East-West road, which was constructed decades ago, is one of the most important roads in Nigeria, as well as its contribution to the economy, stressing that its development of the country cannot be overemphasised. The lawmaker noted that the East-West road spans five states of Rivers, Bayelsa, Delta, Akwa-Ibom and Cross-River, saying the road is in the heart of the oil rich Niger Delta where the oil revenue is derived, and hence very vital to the economic wellbeing of the country. Azaiki said it was in recognition of the importance of the road that the administration of President Olusegun Obansanjo approved the construction of a second carriageway and the rehabilitation of the existing one, adding that sadly, the road is yet to be completed. He lamented that a greater portion of the road in these states have failed even as the project contracted to Setraco Construction Company has been abandoned, noting that the road has become a death trap which causes nightmares to commuters who has to unavoidably use the road.
