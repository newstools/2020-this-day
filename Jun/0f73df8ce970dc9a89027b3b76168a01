By Adedayo Akinwale The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Geoffrey Onyeama, has described the attack on Nigerian Embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia as disgraceful. The minister in a tweet on Thursday said that efforts were being made to bring the suspects to book. In video clips that surfaced online, perpetrators were citizens of Nigeria who were protesting the alleged discriminatory practices and infringement on their fundamental human rights by Indonesian immigration officials. The placard-carrying protesters were heard chanting in the video, “Nigeria is not helping us in this country. We don’t have an Embassy. We no go ‘gree.” Some of the protesters were seen vandalising a white bus on the premises of the Embassy building while others broke the windows and doors of the building. The attack came barely a week after some persons vandalised a building on the premises of the Nigerian High Commission in Accra, Ghana. Onyeama in a tweet described the attack as, “Absolutely deplorable and disgraceful criminal behaviour by Nigerian hooligans who without justification attacked the Nigerian Embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia today. “Every effort will be made to identify them and see they are severely punished. Totally unacceptable behaviour.”
