James Sowole in Akure Traditional rulers in Ondo State Thursday endorsed the incumbent Governor of the state, Mr. Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, for another term in the office, declaring that other aspirants opposing him are wasting their time. The Chairman of the state Council of Obas and the Olugbo of Ugbo, Oba Fredrick Akinruntan spoke on behalf of other tradtional rulers after the end of their monthly meeting held in Akure, the state capital. Akinruntan said the governor deserved the second term following his laudable performance in the state. He said the performance of the governor informed the endorsement by the traditional rulers across the 18 local government areas of the state. Olugbo disclosed that the Council of Obas in the state has already set up a committee in the three senatorial districts to work for the emergence of Akeredolu and his re-election. “We looked at what he has done, particularly the Ore Flyover. Before now, I told someone I was scared to pass through that road since the day I met 18 people dead in an accident on the road. But now look at what Akeredolu has done for us. “That bridge is like Lagos and the United States’ bridges. Look at the way he embraced all the Obas in the state. He has been fantastic. We have not done this for any governor before. These are the Obas from the 18 local government areas of the state. We have set up a senatorial committee to work for the governor. “Those who are contesting with the governor are wasting their time and resources. They should wait for him for another four years and let Aketi ( Akeredolu) finish his second term. “We looked at the things he has done. Look at the roads in Akure; in Okitipupa, in Akoko. We have three senatorial districts,” Olugbo stated. He explained that the monarchs would meet on July 10, 2020 to talk about how Akeredolu will emerge. “He will complete his eight years in office,” Oba Akinruntan added.
