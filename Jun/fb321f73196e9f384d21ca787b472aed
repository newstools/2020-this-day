The presidency on Sunday broke its silence on the “security incident” that occurred at the precincts of the Presidential Villa, Abuja on Thursday night, when the First Lady’s Aide-de-camp, Usman Shugaba, attempted to force President Muhammadu Buhari’s Special Assistant, Sabiu Yusuf, into self -isolation over COVID-19 fears. In a statement on Sunday, Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media, Mallam Garba Shehu, said the Presidency acknowledged concerns expressed by several members of the public regarding the “incident among the occupants of the State House which escalation led to the arrest of some staff by the police.” An altercation that degenerated into firing of gunshots had occurred on Thursday night between the First Lady Aisha Buhari and Sabiu, who is also President Muhammadu Buhari’s nephew, when the wife of the President, accompanied by three of her children and some security aides led by her ADC, attempted to force Sabiu, who had returned to his residence at the precincts of the Presidential Villa, after a trip to Lagos where he had gone to meet his wife who delivered a new baby recently, to go into self-isolation over COVID-19 fears. The ADC and security aides who accompanied her to the residence of Sabiu where the shooting occurred were later arrested on the orders of the Inspector General of Police Mohammed Adamu, after he received security report on the incident. Breaking its silence on the incident, which has generated reactions from across the country, the presidency said President Buhari had directed that proper investigation be carried out by the Police, in compliance with the rule of law. The presidency further said the president had directed that the law should be allowed to take its course. It however frowned on the fact that “a minor occurrence is being used by some critics to justify attacks on the government and the person.” Details shortly…
