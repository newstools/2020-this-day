Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Mr. Sunday Dare, has outlined Nigeria’s expectations from Super Eagles Head Coach Gernot Rohr following the extension of his contract with Nigeria for another two and a half years. The minister while speaking in an interview at the weekend said he was not averse to the contract extension but insisted that Nigerians must get results if the German coach must stay on. “The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) is statutorily in charge of the growth and development of football in Nigeria. Of course, under the supervision of the Ministry of Youth and Sports. Even before I became Minister, there are processes and procedures that are followed when it comes to bringing on a new national coach or renewing the contract of a coach who is already in the house and I think it was important for us to follow the processes and procedures in place. “For Rohr, because he had been signed on earlier, he deserved to be given the right of first refusal, that was what the NFF did and that was what I also allowed to happen. It is best practices, it is global practice but the NFF also had a review of his performance in the last three years and based on that review, his new contract had new conditions that never existed before. “Some of the conditions bother on mode of payment, while some are technical issues regarding the development of our football and that to me, is fundamental.” Mr. Dare added that it would not be business as usual, insisting that the coach would be held to a higher depth of responsibility, a greater depth of technicality and a greater level of success where he could have his contract reviewed if he falls short of the direction outlined in the terms of his contract.
