In one week, President Muhammadu Buhari scored two mesmerizing goals that upped the ante for his party and government. First was his support for Dr. Akinwunmi Adesina, President of the Africa Development Bank (AfDB), which invariably changed the game for a man, who had been rattled over a probe instigated by the US Government and soon after, he nominated Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala to enter into the contest for head of the World Trade Organisation. For a race many had deemed a walkover for Britain’s Lord Peter Mandelson, a tested warhorse of several high profile battles, Okonjo-Iweala’s nomination as a heavyweight African contestant, is currently unsettling the turf and making it a lot more interesting. Indeed, there’s a huge lessons in leaders to always present their best in all things. When they make meritocrazy the foundation of their choices, then, mediocrity takes the back seat. While it is not given that Okonjo-Iweala would win, her choice definitely represents a different mindset and a thought process that shoves politics and nepotism aside for constructive leadership. Kudos!
