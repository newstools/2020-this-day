The Minister of Youth and Sports Development Mr. Sunday Dare has eulogised President Muhammadu Buhari for renaming the Abuja National Stadium after the winner of the acclaimed June 12 1993 presidential election Chief Moshood Abiola, describing the President as a man who chose to walk the path many failed to. The Minister disclosed that the occasion was an attestation of the President’s vision of giving recognition to worthy citizens while encouraging the younger generation to join him in building a “strong, virile and indivisible nation”. While also describing the late Abiola as a great Pan Africanist and a great lover of sports, he said, “Abiola was a consummate sports lover. He invested his time and resources in sports development particular football. Not many sports administrators will forget Abiola in a hurry. “It is therefore fitting and proper for President Buhari to have named our national stadium, an iconic monument after such an illustrious citizen and a lover of sports. This renaming beyond its symbolism will remain a reminder through time of the indelible footprints Abiola left in our political and sports development as a nation. “The naming of this stadium will serve to beckon to other Nigerians with ways and means like Abiola to emulate him and embrace, support and invest in sports development. The President was represented at the occasion by the Minister of the Federal Capital Territory, Mallam Musa Bello as the Special Guest of Honour, while Kola Abiola, represented the family.
