Ekiti State Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, is currently living each day of his political career to expectations, both as the Ekiti governor and Chairman, Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF), with the way and manner he’s carried on. The roles so far being played by Fayemi is such that at then end of the day, especially, when the chips are down, there’s a likely individual who can represent the different demographics in the artery of the nation’s body polity. Definitely not desperate for anything, Fayemi’s role in the recent attempt to save the ruling party, the All Progressives Congress (APC) from itself was inestimable. The situation was such that the judiciary had become the pawn of political and power abuse, with all manners of funny orders and injunctions being secured at the snap of the fingers of whoever could pull it off. Although his traducers do not see his efforts as either progressive or value adding in their reckoning, particularly, a certain category of people otherwise considered unknown quantities in Ekiti State’s political firmament, who had been trying fruitlessly lately to square up with him, Fayemi currently occupies a place in the nation’s political space that clearly defies human comprehension. To challenge him might be to challenge his creator. He represents a future yet unknown. All eyes on him!
