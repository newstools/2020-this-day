By Kuni Tyessi As part of measures toward easing the lockdown to curb the spread of Covid-19 pandemic, the Federal Government has stated that schools running international curriculum are permitted to write their third term exams online. The Minister of State for Education, Dr. Chukwumeka Nwajiuba, who disclosed this in Abuja while fielding questions from journalists at the daily press briefing of the Presidential Taskforce on Covid-19, said this had become necessary as there were private schools licenced to run foreign curriculum essentially for children of expatriates and diplomats. Emphasisng that the lockdown is not a directive to stop learning, Nwajiuba said the approved curricula were targeted at satisfying the ability of such children to be able to re-join the school system of their home countries at the time of need. The Minister said “Schools that operate or run a foreign program in Nigeria and whether they can test for their own third term exams, truly they should and they can. “Private Schools that run International Curriculum are free to conduct their third term examinations online. There are private schools licenced to run foreign curriculum essentially for children of expatriates and diplomats. “If such schools are able to host online classes for the curriculum they operate and they choose to use the period to cover their syllabus, it is permitted,” the Minister said . “We have not said people should stop learning,” he added. It will be recalled that as part of the government’s measures to prevent further transmission of COVID19, schools have remained closed until the Federal Government declares that it is safe for schools to re open .
