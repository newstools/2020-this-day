Bolt, the leading on-demand transportation platform in Africa, has introduced a new ride-type on its platform called Bolt Protect with a protective screen designed to safeguard passengers and drivers against the spread of COVID-19 virus. Vehicles under this new category will be fitted with a protective plastic sheet installed between the front and rear seats to limit the airflow between the driver and passengers thus reducing the possibility of the virus spreading through droplets expelled by sneezes or coughs from an infected person. Speaking on the launch of Bolt Protect, the Country Manager for Bolt Nigeria, Femi Akin-Laguda, stated, “The safety and well-being of our riders and drivers is the most important thing for us at Bolt. With the easing of the lockdown, people need to move around the city and we are doing our best to fulfil our mission of providing safe and affordable Protect rides that cost the same as a standard Bolt ride”. We strongly advise all our drivers and passengers to continue to follow the advice of the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and to take the necessary health measures.” he continued.
Bolt Protect is currently available to Bolt customers in Lagos and Abuja, with plans to expand to more cities soon. Passengers are able to choose the new ride-type when they order a car in the Bolt app at no additional charge since the new category costs the same as the standard Bolt fare. Following government directives, the number of passengers in the category will be limited to 2 persons.
