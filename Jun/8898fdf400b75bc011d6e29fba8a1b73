Rotary club of Eko Atlantic in partnership with Lagos State Waste Management Authority (LAWMA) held a sensitisation on waste segregation to accelerate action on the Environmental discomfort of Nigeria. The RCEA Blue “Bin Recycler Project” led by Rtn. Pallavi Kaurani and supported by Rtn. Shweta Srivastava with the collaboration of WASTE POINT and Alkem, saw residents of LSDPC flats at Adeola Odeku being educated on the need for waste segregation and its importance in the environment. Speaking about the project, the President, RCEA, Rtn Dr Sunit Deb Roy, explained that effective segregation of wastes means that less waste goes to the landfills, which makes it cheaper and better for people and the environment. He said it is also important to segregate waste for public health, especially hazardous wastes that can cause long term health problems, adding that it is very important that they are disposed of correctly and safely and not mixed with the normal waste. The Managing Director, LAWMA, Mr Ibrahim Odumboni with his team were at the LSDPC flats and awarded five best Recyclers. Odumboni highly appreciated the work done by Rotary Club Of Eko Atlantic and extended his complete support for RCEA to spread the awareness of waste segregation beyond the pilot estate.
