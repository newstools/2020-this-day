Deji Elumoye in Abuja The Yoruba socio-cultural group, Afenifere, has told President Muhammadu Buhari to go beyond scolding the security chiefs over their inability to address the security challenges facing the country and relieve them of their duties. Afenifere’s spokesman, Mr. Yinka Odumakin, in a reaction to yesterday’s meeting between Buhari and the service chiefs during which the president expressed his disappointment with the performance of the service chiefs, told THISDAY that it was high time the military top brass were sacked. “Now that the whole world is lamenting the insecurity in Nigeria, will the President do the needful beyond scolding his ineffective chiefs?” According to him, it is unfortunate that it has taken street protests in his home state, Katsina, for the President to now realise that his service chiefs have failed. “Patriotic Nigerians have shouted hoarse over the years that there was no reason to keep these people in office except for personal power consideration”, Odumakin further said.
