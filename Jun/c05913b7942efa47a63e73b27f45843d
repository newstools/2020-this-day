Segun Awofadeji in Bauchi The Nigerian Army has built two blocks of classrooms and renovated another two blocks at Kili Primary School in Darazo Local Government Area of Bauchi State. The Chief of Army Staff, General Tukur Yusuf Buratai, who commissioned the project, explained that it was part of the army’s Corporate Social Responsibility to its host community. Buratai, who was represented by the Commander Nigerian Army Armoured Corps, Bauchi, Major General James Olusola Akomolafe, said Bauchi State hosts the Nigerian Army’s armoured corps, the School of Armour, the 33 Artillery Brigade and other army formations in some local governments. He added that the state government gives them maximum supports to discharge their constitutional duties. According to him, the construction of the new classrooms and renovation of the dilapidated ones would enable pupils to learn under conducive atmosphere. He said that other projects executed in the community included the construction and renovation of stores, offices and toilets, sinking of a borehole with the water adequately reticulated to the entire community as well as two culverts and drainage system constructed to enable easy access and effective channeling of water to prevent erosion in the area. Burutai said: “Before now, Kili Primary School was in a state of disrepair and without portable water, toilet facilities, playground and lack of perimeter fence, to mention but a few. “This really affected the conducive atmosphere for learning by the pupils as most of the classes were being conducted under the trees, thereby making assimilation difficult for pupils.” He said the army had recently rehabilitated a bridge at the Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University, Bauchi that was destroyed by heavy rain last year.
