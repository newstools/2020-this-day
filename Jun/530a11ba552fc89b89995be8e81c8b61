*  Rescue three stolen children, seek parents Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja Police detectives yesterday paraded three kidnap suspects, who kidnapped and killed an Abuja-based medical practitioner, Dr. Benedict Audu, his son and a family friend after the payment of N7.5 million ransom. Audu, 70; his son, Iramon, 32, and Samaila Akenjinba, 30, a friend of the Audu’s family were abducted as they were travelling to Abuja from Takum in Taraba State on March 26, 2020. This comes as it called on parents of three stolen children rescued by the police to come forward for identification. Parading the suspects in Abuja, the Force Public Relations Officer and Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Frank Mba, said the three kidnappers killed the victims even after collecting the sum of N7.5 million as ransom. “The criminals ambushed and took Dr. Audu, his son and a family friend, while they raised a N7million cheque and cash totaling N7.5 million as ransom. “In spite of that, they went ahead and killed and buried them in a shallow grave,”Mba said. The suspects are Ola Opoku, Gwa Tekura and Henry, while other suspects identified as Gana and Tan are on the run. Police at the force headquarters also paraded another kidnap syndicate terrorising Okpoku town in Benue State. The kidnap gang killed Victoria Agbo popularly known as Jamaica. Mba said the kidnappers killed her after collecting N2 million ransom. He said the rampant abduction of people in the area was allegedly coordinated by a head of the vigilante group in the area, Matthew Jerome, who is already in Police custody. Six AK 47 rifles, three pump action rifles and household items were recovered from the kidnappers and another robbery syndicate specialised in robbing residential areas in Abuja. On the rescued children, aged between five and seven years, Mba said six of them were stolen at the age of one. He said three of them were reunited with their family while three are yet to be claimed.
