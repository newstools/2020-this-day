By Olawale Ajimotokan The Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA), has donated food items to 300 vulnerable households in the Federal Capital Territory to alleviate the effect of COVID-19 in Piwoyi community. The Korean Ambassador to Nigeria, Mr. Lee- In -Tae, noted that the assistance to the Nigerian families was in-line with the efforts of the federal government to provide palliatives to families worst hit by the economic impact of COVID-19. Lee noted that Piwoyi was selected because it is the host community of the Nigeria Korea Model School (NKMS), an educational centre constructed through the joint initiative of governments of Korea and Nigeria. He also acknowledged the effort of the federal government towards the alleviation of the suffering of the people of Nigeria and called for greater solidarity to defeat the pandemic. He assured that Korea will continue to work with Nigeria to further improve collaborations that would deliver more benefits to the people of both nations. He also shared the experience of Korea, which was one of the first countries affected by the COVID-19, in dealing with pandemic in the face of adversity. ‘’The Korean people made a bold decision. We prioritised our collective freedom over personal gain. We placed safety and kindness towards our neighbour over stigmatisation and isolation. We actively took responsibility to wear the face mask and adhere to social distancing. Our health professionals tenaciously offered services while citizens showed kindness in acts of sharing,’’ Lee said. He added that Korea attached so much importance to its relations with Nigeria, which is the largest economy in Africa with an overwhelming youth population that has greater potentials towards realising its role among nations.
