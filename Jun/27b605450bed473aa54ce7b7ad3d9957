By Adedayo Akinwale The federal government has said that it has evacuated 56 Nigerians and four Pakistanis from Islamabad to Abuja. The Minister of Foreign Afffairs, Mr. Geoffrey Onyeama, who twitted from his verified Twitter handle on Friday, disclosed that the evacuees arrived Abuja on a chattered aircraft operated by Tarco Aviation Co. He added that about 300 Nigerians are expected to arrive Saturday from the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Onyeama twitted: “Eventually, 56 Nigerians and 4 Pakistanis were safely evacuated from Islamabad to Abuja on a chartered aircraft operated by TARCO AVIATION Co. Ltd. “An @emirates flight from UAE conveying about 300 Nigerians is also expected to land at about 3.55pm from #Dubai.” However, a Twitter user who twitted with the name EmmyDon and twitted from a twitter handle @emmydonkaki, lamented that Nigerians in Indonesia are equally stranded. Also, Aliyu Lawan, who twitted from twitter handle @7586, decried that “not a word was written on repatriation of Nigerians from the Nordic countries (Sweden, Norway, Finland & Denmark) on the embassy’s website. The embassy hosts outdated information with no effective means of communication all this while”.
