By Bennett Oghifo Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki has said he was “dragged and forced into epic political battles” in the last one year, running up to his seeking the mandate of his former All Progressives Congress Party to return as governor on their platform. Obaseki, who was disqualified by the APC from contesting the party’s primary, defected to the Peoples Democratic Party that gave him a nod to represent the party during the September governorship election. In a statement yesterday, the governor thanked Edo people, particularly the leaders of PDP and delegates for voting him as the flag bearer of the party. He said, “How could I have survived the epic political battles that I was dragged and forced into, in the last one year, without you, my people, solidly behind me? I thank my party delegates, who stood all through the day and night, to vote me as the party’s candidate. “This victory is our collective victory and I urge our people to remain vigilant as we kick-start our campaigns for the main election. I appeal to you to remain steadfast in your convictions to enable us to win the war ahead just as we have won several battles together. “My dear people of Edo State, leaders and members of our great party, the PDP, I thank you all for your support and for electing me as the flagbearer of our party in the September governorship election. “I salute leaders of the party who set aside their ambitions in the interest of party unity and the progress of our state. “I thank every Edo man, woman, our resilient youth, home and abroad for making the fight for my emergence, their own. You invested your resources and raised your voices to support my aspiration even in the face of threats and intimidation.”
