Segun Awofadeji in Bauchi The Chairman of the Bauchi State Chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr. Uba Ahmed Nana, has dismissed his purported expulsion from the APC as the “joke of the year and an effort in futility.” Nana, who was reacting to the purported dissolution of the State Executive Council (SEC) of the party led by him by a group within the party yesterday evening, declared that “nobody has the constitutional right to dissolve an elected executive without following the due process. We have a constitution in the APC, which must be duly applied before such a thing can be done.” He described those who allegedly announced the dissolution the SEC as a group of failed politicians who lost out during the party’s congress that was conducted in 2018. “They left the APC for somewhere else. As I am talking to you we are not aware that they are back into the fold of the APC. Maybe that is their way of trying to come back through the back door,” he said. The state’s chairman of APC also dismissed all the allegations leveled against him and other members of the SEC as false and promised to respond to them at an appropriate time. He, therefore, called on all loyal members of the party to disregard any information that did not originated from the party’s state secretariat and urged them to remain focus and faithful to the APC. He also assured them that the APC would recapture Bauchi State in 2023. Nana also denied any knowledge of the purported suspension of Senator Adamu Bulkachuwa by his ward in Azare, which was also denied by the ward’s chairman.
