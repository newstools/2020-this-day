Former Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, has expressed shock over the demise of Senator Abiola Ajimobi whom he described as a rare politician. He said it was with great shock he received the news of the passing of his dear friend and brother, adding that it was very hard for him to accept that a true friend and a loyal brother was gone. “I recall that our last moments together was at the National Working Committee (NWC) of our great party, All Progressives Congress (APC), just few weeks ago. He flew into Abuja that day for the meeting. “As usual, he brought his deep insights, candor and infectious humour to bear in his contributions as the National Vice Chairman to our discussion that day. You couldn’t fault his forensic logic, nor resist his disarming jokes. “He appeared robust and healthy. “Against this backdrop, nothing could therefore have prepared me to entertain the suspicion – much less, the thoughts – that that would be our last interaction. “A family man who treasured the company of his wife and children more than anything, he was in a hurry to return to his Ibadan home as soon as the meeting ended. “Alas, the news came few days later that he had taken ill. It will therefore not be incorrect to say that Senator Ajimobi met his death serving our great party, APC. “Indeed, my relationship with Senator Ajimobi transcended partisan politics. As fellow governors, we struck an uncommon rapport. We spoke often on anything – personal, politics and public interest. We drew even closer after we both served out our terms as governors of Oyo and Edo States,” he noted.
