By Olawale Ajimotokan The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Ministerial Task Team on COVID -19, yesterday sealed the popular Jabi Lake Mall in Abuja for two weeks for alleged contravention of the Presidential Task Force (PTF) protocols on social gatherings and the 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. curfew imposed to contain the spread of COVID-19. The popular shopping mall was shut for staging a musical concert on Friday night, where the hip hop act, Naira Marley was the top performer. The FCT Mobile Court, headed by Magistrate Idayat Akonni, which sat in the mall’s premises, preferred three charges against the management of the shopping mall for the offence. It sealed the mall for two weeks for default of the COVID-19 protocols. The crowd at the ‘’Drive in Concert’’ was large that organisers found it difficult to put it under control The Chairman of FCT Ministerial Enforcement Task-team on COVID-19 Restrictions, Ikharo Attah flayed the management of Jabi Lake Mall for violating the protocols of FCTA on COVID – 19 control by giving permission to Naira Marley to hold a concert in the premises of the Mall as well as conducting business activities beyond the normal hours allowed by the authorities. Attah described the event as an embarrassment for the FCTA, adding it put the effort to control the spread of the virus in the FCT at great risk. When asked if the FCTA would consider declaring Marley, who had since returned to Lagos wanted, Attah said: “He flew into Abuja Friday from Lagos and returned back same day to the nation’s former capital city. “We are convinced that the Lagos State Government, which had in recent past had unpleasant experience with the artist will do the needful since he also breached the inter-state travel ban which applies to Lagos State”.
