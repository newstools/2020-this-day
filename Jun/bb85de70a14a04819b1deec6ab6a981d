Roger Federer has confirmed he is set to miss the rest of the 2020 tennis season after undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery – but has assured fans he will be back in time for 2021, the year he turns 40. The 20-time Grand Slam champion has opted to sit out the remaining two of 2020 – the US and French Opens – in order to fully recover from a niggling knee problem. Taking to social media with a letter to his fans, the Swiss said: ‘A few weeks ago, having experienced a setback during my initial rehabilitation, I had to have an additional quick arthroscopic procedure on my right knee. ‘Now, much like I did leading up to the 2017 season, I plan to take the necessary time to be 100% ready to play at my highest level. ‘I will be missing my fans and the tour dearly but, I will look forward to seeing everyone back on tour at the start of the 2021 season.’ The 38-year-old reached the semi-finals of the Australian Open in his last foray at a Grand Slam in January, losing in straight sets to Novak Djokovic. On paper, the two Grand Slams Federer is set to miss in the remainder of 2020 – the US Open in August and the rescheduled French in late September – are his two weakest. He has won the French once, in 2009, and the US Open five times, while he has eight triumphs at Wimbledon and six at the Australian. Federer’s time out mean the next major tournament he is likely to play in will be the 2021 Australian Open, exactly a year on from when he last took to the court at a Grand Slam. He will turn 40 in August 2021.
