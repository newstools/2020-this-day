Samuel Chukwueze and his Villarreal teammates’ push for a top four finish and UEFA Champions League football next season picked momentum yesterday as they defeated Valencia 2-0 in the Spanish La Liga match-day 32 fixture. The Super Eagles forward played 89 minutes before he was substituted in a tactical move to kill off the game by Javier Onteviros. The victory moves Villarreal one step up to fifth spot on 51 points, just three points below fourth placed Sevilla. In the event of not able to finish in the top four, Chukwueze and his colleagues are sure of a Europa ticket as consolation. Former Valencia forward Paco Alcacer opened the scoring with a fantastic volley on the turn in the 14th minute but opted against celebrating against the club where he began his career. Alcacer’s strike partner Gerard Moreno scored an even better goal to double the lead in the 44th, as goalkeeper Sergio Asenjo launched the ball upfield and former Arsenal playmaker Santi Cazorla controlled it in the air with an irresistible touch before Moreno’s ferocious volley.
