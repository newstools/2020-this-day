MTN Nigeria has empowered business owners in Lagos with equipment worth millions of Naira. The gesture is part of the company’s effort to improve lives for Nigerians through the MTN “Turn It Up” Youth Entrepreneurship Development Programme (YEDP) and cushion the effect of COVID-19. The company had earlier launched ‘Turn It Up’, a thematic campaign meant to encourage Nigerians to look within and amplify their inherent potentials. Individuals who wanted to improve on their business were identified in Lagos, Abuja and Aba. Some of the items distributed to the SMEs include Industrial Sewing Machines, Deep Freezers, Mixers, Diesel Generators, Weaving Machines and Digital Cameras. Subsequently, the company plans to reach out to other recipients in Abuja and Aba in a few weeks. Speaking on the redemption, General Manager, Brands and Communications MTN Nigeria, Richard Iweanogie said: “These are trying times for businesses. Nobody expected what we now know as COVID-19, and it has affected a lot of people. We thought this was the best time to hand this equipment to the businesses we identified earlier in the year. A lot can still be achieved if we help each other. I hope these items help them grow their businesses.” Ahmadu Japheth, a resident of Alausa, Ikeja, Lagos, after receiving a sewing machine and weaving machine said: “I remember when I was fortunate enough to be at the mall in Ikeja in January, where I shared my story with MTN and told them what I needed to turn up my business. Immediately I did, I knew they were going to help me and I am grateful, this is coming at a perfect time because I have been home doing nothing since this pandemic started. Now I can focus fully on my craft all thanks to MTN.”
