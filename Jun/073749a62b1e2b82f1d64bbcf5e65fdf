First Lady Aisha Buhari has asked the Inspector General of Police, Mohammad Adamu, to release her aides from detention. In tweets from.her verified twitter handle @aishambuhari on Friday night, the first lady wrote: “That Covid-19 is real and still very much around in our nation is not in doubt. Consequently, I call on all relevant Government Agencies to enforce the Quarantine Act signed by Mr. President and ensure no one is found violating this law and the NCDC guidelines especially on interstate travel without the necessary exemptions for movement of essentials. Anyone who does that should at the very least be made to under go a 14 days mandatory isolation no matter who the person is, no one should be above the law and the Police command will do well to remember that. “Finally, I call on the IGP to release my assigned Staff who are still in the custody of the Police in order to avoid putting their lives in danger or exposure to Covid-19 while in their custody.” Mrs Buhari did however not disclose the identities of her aides detained neither did she say when or why they were detained.
