Peak Milk recently served breakfast to health workers and patients at select isolation centres in Lagos to mark the World Milk Day celebration. Observed on the 1st of June annually across the world, the World Milk Day is set aside to actively encourage the daily consumption of milk and dairy. A statement disclosed that this year, Peak Milk re-emphasised the message by serving healthy milk- filled breakfast to healthcare workers and patients – especially those at the frontline of the COVID-19 battle. According to the Marketing Director at FrieslandCampina WAMCO, makers of Peak, Chris Wulff-Caesar, “In a show of gratitude for their valour and service to humanity, we catered healthy breakfast meals to caregivers and their patients at isolation centres in Lagos and being the leading milk brand in Nigeria, Peak has made it imperative to celebrate World Milk Day by championing this breakfast of hope; as it provides an opportunity to further raise awareness about the benefits of consuming dairy.” In celebrating this year World Milk Day, Peak Milk also partnered with Nutrition Society of Nigeria to enlighten Nigerians on the importance of incorporating milk into their daily food plan, particularly at breakfast, through relevant media platforms.
