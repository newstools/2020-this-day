Tobi Soniyi President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday reappointed Professor Umar Garba Danbatta as the Executive Vice Chairman, Nigerian Communications Commission. Professor Danbatta’s reappointment was based on the recommendation of the Honourable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr Isa Ali Ibrahim (Pantami), in line with the Nigerian Communications Act, 2003. The minister said the renewal of the appointment was to consolidate the gains made in the telecommunications sector in line with the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy. While wishing Danbatta the best, the minister directed him to significantly improve on the overall performance of the commission as well as ensure that adequate mechanisms are put in place to facilitate the implementation of all policies of federal government through the ministry. He further charged him to ensure that the interest of telecommunication consumers, Nigerians and investors are adequately protected. Danbatta was appointed the Executive Vice Chairman of NCC by President Buhari in 2015 or five year tenure after the expiration of the two tenure of his predecessor Eugine Juwa. Reacting to the renewal of Danbatta, NCC in an advertorial commended President Buhari for his visionary leadership as demonstrated by the approval of the designation of the Telecommunications Infrastructure as Critical National Infrastructure. The commission said the decision would in no small way provide the needed protection for the infrastructure that had been subjected to vandalization over the years. It said: “Mr President , we truly appreciate your leadership. The success the industry has recorded in the last five years is due in no small part to your support.”
