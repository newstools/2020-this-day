Yinka Kolawole in Osogbo This appears not to be the best of times for a former governorship aspirant under the umbrella of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Osun State, Dr Akin Ogunbiyi, as no fewer than fifteen members of his campaign group named ‘Idera De Movement’ have dumped the body and switched over to ‘Imole De’ of Senator Ademola Adeleke within the same party. The former Ogunbiyi’s field officers in a press conference addressed in Osogbo yesterday adduced various reasons for their resolve to pitch their tent with Adeleke. The spokesman of the disenchanted Ogunbiyi’s campaign field officers, Mr Kingsley Awosiyan from Ife-Central Local Government Council Area of Osun State, accused their former political principal of flirting with the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC) both in Osun and neighbouring states. The ex-Ogunbiyi campaign field officers said, the result of their assessment of the activities and disposition of their former principal to the PDP plight in the state was indicative of the fact that it would continue to have a negative effect on the fortune of the party either now or in the nearest future. Awosiyan disclosed that having weighed all the prevailing options he and his colleagues arrived at a conclusion to unequivocally go with Adeleke. They reminded their former principal how they served him diligently and with absolute loyalty when it mattered and wondered why he chose to sideline them lately. They however, pledged to work conscientiously in their new political abode to ensure overall victory for the PDP in all future elections in the state
