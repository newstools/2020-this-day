The immediate past Speaker of the Edo Assembly, Alhaji Kabiru Adjoto, has resigned his membership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state. Adjoto, who made this known in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) yesterday in Benin City, said he took the decision after deeply consulting with his conscience, family, friends and his teeming supporters. He said resignation was also in line with Article 9.5(i) of the APC constitution. He noted that the decision was nostalgically clothed with apparel of mixed feelings as it translated to leaving the party he had contributed to build for more than a decade. He, however, said that the necessity of his decision to resign was firmly hinged on the interest of his supporters and Edo people in general, saying “my resignation takes immediate effect.”
