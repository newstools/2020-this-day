The reports linking Barcelona wonderkid Ansu Fati with Manchester United are untrue, according to the player’s father. Reports in recent weeks have suggested that Fati is subject of a bid in the region of £135million from the Red Devils with the Catalan giants reportedly immediately rejecting the offer. However, Bori Fati has revealed in an interview with El Larguero, as reported by AS, that reports linking his son with a move to Old Trafford are false and that his son is happy at the Nou Camp. ‘We are enjoying life at Barcelona,’ Bori Fati said. ‘But my son must be patient for his chances, as he is playing with the greatest footballer ever in Lionel Messi. ‘The United links are not true, Ansu is happy here, he is following his dreams. He does not have to start every game, and he has Griezmann and Suarez ahead of him. Ansu has a lot of time.’ According to a report from Mundo Deportivo last weekend, Fati has zero interest in leaving Spain. The Spanish news outlet’s sources said the player is ‘calm’ because he will soon sign his first professional contract with the club which will include a transfer clause of £362m. Fati has scored six times in LaLiga this season and has made 26 appearances in what has been an impressive campaign. Hopes are high that he can go on to succeed Messi once the Argentine decides to hang up his boots. Barca’s club director Xavier Vilajoana recently denied they were prepared to cash in on Fati. He said: ‘For us, there’s no story with Ansu, we have never spoken about selling him. ‘We won’t use players from the academy to make cash. ‘In principle, we have no intention of selling the players we believe will make the first team.’
