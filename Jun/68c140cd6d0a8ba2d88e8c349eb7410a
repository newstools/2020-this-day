Jurgen Klopp says Liverpool’s trophy-laden past is no longer a “burden” for his players following their Premier League title win. After he was appointed manager in 2015, Klopp told his squad they must create their own history. They have done just that, their first league crown in 30 years capping an incredible 12 months where they also won the Champions League, Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup. Speaking exclusively to Sky Sports News on Friday, Klopp said Liverpool have got rid of the “heavy backpack”. “The history is no burden anymore,” he said. “The history is now our wonderful background, it’s the basis for what we are doing. “When I came in we had to say, don’t compare us anymore with the fantastic people who played for this club and won everything in the past. We needed to get the opportunity from our supporters to find our own way. “This was only possible because nobody lost patience with us in any moment. “Football management is a nice job but a difficult one as well, we cannot really ask for time. We have to deliver immediately. People have to see the steps we make; Liverpool fans saw them because they wanted to see them. This story was possible then.”
