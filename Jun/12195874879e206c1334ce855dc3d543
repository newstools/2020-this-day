President Muhammadu Buhari has said that all the local governments that were taken over by the Boko Haram insurgents in Borno, Yobe and Adamawa States have long been recovered and are now occupied by indigenes of these areas who were hitherto forced to seek a living in areas far from their ancestral homes. Buhari, in a nationwide broadcast commemorating the 2020 Democracy Day, added that: “The total collapse of the economies of these areas, which constituted a threat to our food security, has also been reversed with the gradual recovery of farming and other economic activities.” Meanwhile, he said he regretted the recent sporadic incidents with tragic loss of lives in Katsina and Borno States as a result of criminals taking advantage of Covid-19 restrictions. He said: “Security agencies will pursue the perpetrators and bring them to swift justice.”
