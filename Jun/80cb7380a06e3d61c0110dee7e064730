By Onyebuchi Ezigbo Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige, has said that the South-west and Nigerian politics will miss former Oyo State Governor, late Senator Abiola Ajimobi and his progressive style of politics. Ngige, who described the late Ajimobi as a close ally, described his death as sad and shocking. In a statement signed by his media aide, Emmanuel Nzomiwu, the minister recalled that in very tense occasions in political meetings, Ajimobi’s jokes and humour came handy, adding that he exhibited so much wittiness in his interaction with people. According to the labour minister, such politicians who spice up politics with humour were rare and uncommon to find in Nigeria. Ngige said, “Ajimobi was a bundle of jokes and humour. In very tense occasions in political meetings, his jokes and humour came handy. His jokes were embedded in humour. It is rare to find such politicians who spice up politics with humour in Nigeria. His jokes and humour will be missed in the entire political landscape of Nigeria. The politics of South-west, especially Ibadan, the hotbed of the region’s political maneuverings will definitely take a new colour. “He is a thoroughbred progressive politician. The progressives in Nigerian politics will miss him dearly. The last time we met, we agreed that he will host his birthday in Abuja because I did not attend his birthday in Ibadan. I am pained and saddened by his death,” he said. Ngige commiserated with all those he left behind, particularly his wife, children, the entire members of Ajimobi family and the people of Oyo State. He urged God to give all of them the fortitude to bear this great loss of a cherished and loved on. Senator Ajimobi had died in Lagos from complications of COVID-19 disease at the age of 70.
