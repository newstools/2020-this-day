Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja In continuation of the renewed offensive to rid the North-west and North-central states of criminal elements, the Air Component of Operation Hadarin Daji yesterday destroyed some armed bandits’ camps in a forest in Katsina State – south of Birnin Kogo along the Katsina-Zamfara boundary area. The air strikes were executed as part of the missions under the subsidiary Operation Accord after Human Intelligence (HUMINT) reports as well as series of Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions indicated that some clusters of huts in the area were being used as mini-camps by members of notorious armed bandits’ gang led by one “Adamu Aleiro”. Consequently, the air component dispatched a force package of Nigerian Air Force (NAF) attack aircraft and helicopter gunships to engage the area, leading to the destruction of three of the targeted camps, some of which were seen engulfed in flames. Several of the criminals were also neutralised in the process, a military update said. The statement further noted that the Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), Air Chief Marshal Sadique Abubakar, commended the air component of Operation Hadarin Daji for their professionalism and urged them to remain resolute in the conduct of air strikes whilst continuing to provide close air support for ongoing ground operations in order to eradicate all armed bandits thus accomplishing the directives of the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) to restore normalcy in the North-west and North-central zones of the country.
