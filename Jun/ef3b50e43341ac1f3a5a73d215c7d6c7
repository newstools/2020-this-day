Duro Ikhazuagbe Plans by Lille to reap bountifully from the sale of Victor Osimhen is perhaps stalling why the Nigerian forward may remain longer at the French Ligue 1 season beyond this summer transfer window. Coppa Italian winners Napoli and several Premier League clubs have been linked with interests in Osimhen due to his spectacular form this season in France but Lille President, Gerard Lopez, is reportedly not shifting ground on his 80million Euros asking fee. But the coronavirus pandemic that disrupted football and others sporting activities around the world is believed to have dropped the value of some players including Osimhen. Lopez is banking on Lille reaping in the same manner they did from the sale of Nicolas Pepe to Arsenal for 72million Pounds last season. “Last year, we asked for the same amount for Nicolas Pépé. Some observers thought I set the bar way too high, but later Arsenal paid £ 72 million. Victor (Osimhen) is worth as much,” the Lille Chairman said in reports in French media yesterday. Osimhen who buried his 80-year old late father, Patrick last weekend in Lagos was initially believed to have reached personal terms with Napoli but Lopez’s insistence on 80million Euros appears to have put discussions on hold. The Lille Boss appears on the look out for the highest bidder and not necessarily where the player will have career growth. Lille Manager Christophe Galtier earlier made his intentions known that he is open for the departure of his prized goal poacher. The 21-year-old striker cost Lille 12 million Euros from Belgian club Charleroi, who had bought him for 3.5 million Euros from Bundesliga side Wolfsburg after a successful loan spell.
