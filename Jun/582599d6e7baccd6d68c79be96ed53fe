A United States of America-born swimmer, Philip Adejumo, has stated why he dumped his place of birth and residence to pick to represent Nigeria. Adejumo revealed this to BCOS TV’s Boluwaji Ogunmola that he decided to represent Nigeria because he believes he had more to offer Nigeria than to the US. The dark skinned swimmer while featuring on BCOS TV sports programme produced by Adewale Tijani ‘Fans Forum’ added that his decision to don the green – white – green of Nigeria was hinged on his belief that Africa’s most populous country would give him greater opportunities to showcase his talents. ” I opted for Nigeria because I believe that they will give me better chance to compete at the highest level,” Adejumo said on Fans Forum. The swimmer added that he has no regrets about his decision to represent Nigeria. “I was not disappointed. Nigerian officials welcomed me wholeheartedly with my Oyinbo accent, and they are very supportive of me. In fact, joining Nigeria is my best ever decision”, he stated. A lover of Nigerian musicians like Davido, Wiz Kid and Burna Boy, Philip Adejumo was born in the U.S to Nigerian parents who hailed from Ogbomoso, Oyo state. Adejumo, who started swimming at the age of six, is the fastest Nigerian swimmer in the 100 metres free style and butterfly events. He is also a five time National Record Holder.
