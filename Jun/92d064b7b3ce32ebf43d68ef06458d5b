There was anxiety thursday over the health of a former Governor of Oyo State, Senator Abiola Ajimobi, following reports on the social media that he was dead. But his daughter, Mrs. Fatima Ganduje-Ajimobi, has debunked reports of his death, saying the Acting National Chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC), is alive. Ganduje-Ajimobi, in a tweet last night, said: “Thank you for all the messages but our father is still alive, alhamdulillah. When it is our time we will all die so wait first…” Also reacting, Ajimobi’s Special Adviser on Communication and Strategy, Mr. Bolaji Tunji, said his principal was alive and responding to treatment. In a post on his social media handles, Tunji urged Nigerians to pray for the recovery of the APC chieftain. Ajimobi was appointed Acting National chairman of the party on Tuesday following the suspension of the substantive National Chairman, Mr. Adams Oshiomhole.
