By Michael Olugbode Rapists would be made to face the full wrath of the law, Yobe State Governor, Alhaji Mai-Mala Buni has said. The governor said the law of the state, which stipulates life imprisonment for rape against minor and 25 years for rape committed against adult, would be strictly enforced. The governor, in a statement by his spokesman, Mallam Mamman Mohammed on Friday tasked community leaders in the state to be extra vigilant and report any case of rape in their domains to the appropriate authorities. He equally charged the police and judiciary to conduct adequate investigations and expedite action on the judicial process and procedures to ensure that rapists are brought to book. He warned that government will not tolerate any abuse deliberately caused by reckless persons who have no control over themselves. He said: “The full wrath of the law will be applied on anyone who is proven to have committed rape in the state.” The state law against rape, kidnapping and unnatural offences which was signed in 2018 provides life imprisonment for rape against minors and up to 25 years imprisonment for raping adults. The law also stated that whoever commits the offence of kidnapping shall on conviction be punished with imprisonment of not less than fourteen (14) years. It could be reported that recently incidents of rape were reported in the state and this could have warranted the statement from the governor.
