What better proof does anyone need to be convinced that Hon. Abiodun Isiaq Akinlade was born under the proverbial lucky star? Perhaps, if you are one of the doubting Thomases, the ovation that greeted his confirmation, last week, as the Federal Commissioner representing Ogun State in the Federal Character Commission, should have been the ace in the hole. Akinlade, who represented the good people of Yewa South/Ipokia federal constituency between 2003 and 2015, has continued to make his influence and foray count in both his West senatorial district and the Gateway State at large. For the Baba Adinni of Yewaland, who enjoys strong cordiality with his governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, his appointment by President Muhammadu Buhari and subsequent confirmation by the Senate, met with unanimous jubilation and approval across the state without any dissenting voice. Of course, not a few are said to be interested in unravelling the secret behind his meteoric rise. Perhaps, what fuels this is the fact that the All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain, who is an unapologetic, loyal party man, has now become a rallying point of network and influence in Ogun West. But investigations revealed that his standout qualities that have made him relevant over the years are his ability to listen to people, connect with them and intelligently take actions that will benefit the populace.
Similarly, the ever-smiling Akinlade has carved a niche for himself when it comes to giving and empowerment, and this has made him to be one of the most benevolent politicians in Ogun State. Interestingly, he does this without making any noise about it. As the former Chairman of the House Committee on Science and Technology delves into his new portfolio at the Federal Character Commission, it is expected that he will continue to display the strong and enviable leadership he is known for.
