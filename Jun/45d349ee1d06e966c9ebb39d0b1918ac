Olawale Ajimotokan in Abuja The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and other stakeholders yesterday launched the Agric for Food and Jobs Plan (AFJP) initiative aimed at mitigating the impact of the COVID-19 on food production in the country. The joint venture for the private sector via out- grower and farmers’ scheme was aimed at increasing the supply of locally grown food while simultaneously creating employment opportunities in the agricultural sector. Other key stakeholders in the initiative are the state governments and the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.
The Senior Special Assistant to the President on Agriculture, Andrew Kwasari, said the pandemic has affected the food sector and led to job losses. He said the joint venture would be achieved through investment in the sector by providing zero-interest input financing options such as fertilisers and seeds to farmers across the 36 states and FCT to produce foods and sell locally and internationally. The programme would run for a duration of 12 months, targeting an aggregate of two million hectres of land for farming and livestock production. Kwasari, stressed that in collaboration with the N-Power scheme, trained enumerators have been deployed to identify farmers and their farms to properly reach the beneficiaries.
The AFJP targets two million smallholder farmers across the states and aims to produce 10 million tonnes of food in the next 12 months. ”The priority crops and livestock targeted by AFJP for local market are rice, maize, sorghum, groundnuts, cowpea, cassava, millet, livestock, palm kernel and cotton; while sesame seeds, hibiscus, cocoa, hides and skin; horns and hoofs are targeted for export market,”Kwasari said. He stressed that AFJP is different from the Anchor Borrowers Programme, a long-term scheme launched by CBN in 2015 to create a linkage between anchor companies involved in food processing and small holder farmers.
