The General Manager/Chief Executive Officer of Enugu State Housing Development Corporation (ESHDC), Mr. Chukwuemelie Lambert Agu, has commended Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi for the construction of the 13-kilometre Nike Lake Junction-Harmony Estate-Amorji Nike- Adoration Pilgrimage Centre –Orie Emene Road. The massive virgin road cuts across the thick forest of Umuchigbo community in Enugu East Local Government Area, where one of the corporation’s biggest low cost housing estates is located. Reacting to the project, which was recently inaugurated by Governor Ugwuanyi amid jubilation, the ESHDC’s Chief Executive Officer disclosed that the road has opened up the Harmony Estate for rapid development. Agu added that the socio-economic value of the estate has appreciated, stressing that “this is a welcome development towards our vision to provide and encourage proliferation of affordable housing for the people of Enugu State.” He, therefore, called on the public, especially allottees in the Harmony Estate, to take advantage of the recent massive road project in the area, by the Enugu State government, to develop their property, to encourage the governor’s sound vision for the state.
