By Segun James The Presiding Bishop of the Living Faith International, better known as Winners’ Chapel, Bishop David Oyedepo, yesterday lamented that markets in Lagos and Ogun states are now free from COVID-19, while the churches in the two states have been infected with the virus, resulting in the reopening of the markets and the continued closure of the churches. Delivering his sermon, Oyedepo said it was ironic that markets where people no longer observe social distancing have remained open, while the church has remained closed. Oyedepo insisted that refusing to open the church was in contravention of the freedom of worship which is a breach of the Nigerian constitution. “No handwashing, no nothing – everyone is in the market running over each other every day of the week and there is no outbreak from the market but there is now outbreak, perceived outbreak from the church. Prophets are God’s voices to the nations. Caution! “Now, freedom of worship is no longer a constitutional right but now determined by some individuals. It is a hard thing to kick against the priest. This is no longer coronavirus in Lagos and Ogun. It is now anti-church virus clean and clear.” The cleric noted that the church which had the power to heal people remained closed, while markets with no healing power have remained closed, adding that in the last one week, 10 people testified to have been healed of the virus. “Can anybody silence the church? Never! I have never heard of anybody that God healed in the market but people get healed in every church day and night, real tangible healing. We have recorded 114 coronavirus healing testimonies. We got 10 this week. “And that is the place that is vulnerable, not the market,” Oyedepo insisted.
