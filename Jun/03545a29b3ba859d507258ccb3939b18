Competitive fencing has always been a male dominated sport and Rainbow Colleges’ Natania Emusan is breaking the status Quo after winning a Bronze Medal at the international fencing competition in Ghana. The tournament which was hosted in February, 2020 welcomed 18 African countries participating in the 5 day event. Ghana Olympic Committee (GOC) President, Ben Nunoo Mensah together with the President of Women in Sports Ghana, Joyce Mahama was present to appreciate and encourage the participants for their tenacity in a sport which is paid very little attention. Barely 6 months into fencing, Natainia embraced the sport saying “I chose fencing initially for the purpose of recreation because Rainbow College encourages us to try different extracurricular activities but I got more interested in the complexity of the sport and found its ability to help activate critical thinking skills very useful in my day-to-day life. Fencing is more than just a recreational activity for me, My goal is to fence for Nigeria at the Olympics” Speaking on her other passions Nataina says “After high school, I would like to own a software, I want to study software programming because other than fencing, I have a passion for technology and thankfully Rainbow College equips me for both” As one of the original ten sporting activities, fencing entered the Olympic Games with individual foil in 1924 and we are proud of one of our own making inroads into the sport with skillset and passion. Congratulations to Natania for a well-deserved win! We can’t wait have the kids back on campus, doing the things they love.
