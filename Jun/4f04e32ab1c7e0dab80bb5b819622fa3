Omon-Julius Onabu in Asaba The abductors of the Principal Medical Officer at General Hospital, Ojobo in Burutu Local Government Area of Delta State, Dr. Wisdom Iboyitete, have reportedly contacted the family of the abductee, demanding a N5 million (Five Million Naira) ransom for his release. Family sources claimed that the criminals opened a line of negotiation on Tuesday, a day after the kidnap of the doctor in the wee hours of Monday, and made an initially demand of hundreds of millions of Naira but were said to have come down to N5 million on yesterday. Since the hoodlums reportedly whisked the doctor away in a speedboat, local leaders of the Ojobo riverside community were said to have made frantic efforts to rescue the victim unhurt, demanding that he should be released unconditionally. Iboyitete was said to be on duty when the criminals came into the hospital in the wee hours of the fateful day while pretending to have conveyed one of them that was very ill and needed urgent medical attention. They then pounced on the doctor while a nurse on duty at the time managed to escape into the bush, screaming to alert residents of the area but the hoodlums speeded off to unknown destination with their victim in the boat. However, the Delta State branch of the association of medical practitioners have declared a two-day warning strike to protest the kidnap, beginning on Tuesday, June 2, 2020. The two-day warning strike was declared by the state branch of the National Association of Government General Medical and Dental Practitioners (NAGGMDP) at the end of an emergency meeting of the body on the same day their colleague was kidnaped.
