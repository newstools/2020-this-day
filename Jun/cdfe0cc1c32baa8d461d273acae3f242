Mary Nnah Social distancing is our new reality. Yet, we can’t help but miss the simple things we once took for granted – like sharing warm hugs with our loved ones, dining out, playing sports, Owambe parties and more! Everything feels different, but thankfully stress-free banking doesn’t have to be one of those necessities we must give up. The economy might be re-opening, but that doesn’t mean we should open ourselves up to infection along with it. To ensure that doesn’t happen we must minimise our exposure by being in public spaces only when absolutely necessary. Why do you have to go out to get groceries if you can have them delivered to your doorstep? Why do you have to go out to pay your utility bills when you can do that right from the comfort of your home? Above all, why should you endure the long queues and unavoidable physical contact of banking halls when you can get all your banking services right on your mobile device? ALAT is Nigeria’s first fully-digital bank, built from scratch to be used and enjoyed as an entirely digital experience, thereby making all banking services available to you anywhere you can access the internet. From confirming your balance to making payments, paying utility bills, accessing loans, scheduling payments, saving and more, ALAT is making banking extremely easy. It gets better. If you are unhappy about any service you received through ALAT, you can always lodge a complaint with Purple Connect, WEMA Bank’s Call Centre. Dedicated and well-trained personnel who understand that at the core of any excellent customer support, only a 100% satisfaction rate is acceptable, are available 24/7 to attend to you. With ALAT, you can make payments from anywhere in the world, and maintain a 6feet distance with ease. ALAT does much more than make banking easy, it makes it enjoyable and seamless!
