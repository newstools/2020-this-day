Speaking with THISDAY yesterday in Kano, Jili added that one person was electrocuted in Ja’in area while the remaining five were trapped in a rubble of a collapsed building all in Gwale Local Government Area following the downpour. The SEMA boss also listed the five affected local government areas as Gwale, Gwarzo, Kibiya and Rimingado. According to him, “It was based on the reports that we visited Kibiya and Rimingado Local Government Areas, where we presented relief materials to the victims as an interim measure to alleviate their sufferings.” He said the agency was still expecting reports of the disaster from officials of other local government areas in the state as the rainstorm had affected many people across the 44 local government areas of the state.

He warned residents of the state, especially those living in flood-prone areas, to desist from dumping refuse in water
