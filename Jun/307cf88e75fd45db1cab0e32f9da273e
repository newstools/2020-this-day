A community development group, Iro Progressive Union (IPU), has donated palliative items worth thousands of naira to Iro-Ekiti in Gbonyin Local Government Area of Ekiti State. While presenting the items through the traditional ruler of the community, Oba Felix Adeniyi Afolabi, Adeyiba III, on behalf of the President of the group, Chief Stephen Omolale, at the weekend, the Chairman of the Special COVID-19 Palliatives Committee, Deacon Dele Ogunsemoyin, said the fund with which the items were procured was contributed by the sons and daughters of the community both at home and abroad as well as some of their friends. He said IPU, which is the umbrella organisation for all the indigenes of the community, was touched by the disruption of the sources of livelihood of the townsfolk due to the debilitating effects of COVID-19 and “we felt the only way we could help our people is to come together and do something for them, no matter how small they are.” The chairman, who was accompanied by two other members of the committee at the presentation ceremony-Mr. Wale Obadoye and Mrs. Oluwakemi Daramola-commended those who made the project a reality, and pledged that the union would do more to help the people once the resources are made available to it. While thanking God that no indigene of the community at home and in the Diaspora had fallen victim of the virus, Ogunsemoyin used the opportunity of the ceremony to advise the people to always take all preventive measures to avoid contracting the virus. Responding, Oba Afolabi, supported by many of his chiefs, expressed gratitude to IPU for the gesture, and prayed for God’s blessings and protection for members of the group at home and in the Diaspora. He appealed for unity among the indigenes of the community, saying this remained the quickest way to greater development. Some of the items donated were bags of rice, beans, Semovita, salt among others.
