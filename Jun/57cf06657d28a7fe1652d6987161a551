Loud Whispers with Joseph Edgar My brother Magnus Onyibe just wrote a very powerful book on the late Chief of Staff to the President, Abba Kyari. I have seen the book and immediately reached out to him to ask why he wrote the book. He said something about the good, the bad, and the ugly. I just dey look my brother. This is a first, sha. According to him, the late influencer was all of those three to people depending on which spectrum of the society you belong to. So, what he did was to compile tributes and essays about the man that fell into those three broad categories for the book. I am still reading o and I have already seen contributions from such erudite scholars like Dr. Rueben Abati and my former oga Steve Osuji. But the one that has touched me, is the one written by his daughter, Aisha. It was so touching as it gave us a side of the late strongman most of us never knew. I liked the prose and she was quite emotive as she narrated those times with her father. Mbok, donâ€™t let me go and write too much before some of you will now not go and buy the book. I think the book is a must-read as it would give you better insights on the power configuration of our country better explaining why some people act the way they do. My brother all that you see is not real o. This is truly Nigeria. Get the book.
