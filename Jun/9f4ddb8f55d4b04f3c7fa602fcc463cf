James Sowole in Akure The Ondo State Governor, Mr. Oluwarotimi Akeredolu and his predecessor, Dr. Olusegun Mimiko yesterday commiserated with the Ekiti State Government and the people of the state on the demise of a former governor of old Ondo State, Mr. Bamidele Olumilua. Akeredolu in statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Segun Ajibiye described the late Olumilua as a consummate politician who achieved remarkable and indelible feats as the governor of the old Ondo state from January 1992 to November 1993. The governor described Olumilua as a great mind who injected a lot of thinking into governance while conducting the affairs of the old Ondo state, from which Ekiti State was created. Akeredolu said the demise of the illustrious son of Ekiti amounted to further depletion of the generation of politicians who believe that politics and governance are about service to the people. Mimiko in a statement he personally signed described Olumilua as a consummate politician, humanist, man of faith, and a lover of the masses. The former governor, who served under Olumilua as Commissioner for Health, said he was a true leader. “Ours was a relationship that was never broken by partisanship, time and or location. He remained true to his leadership roles to me till the end and I valued him like a true political beneficiary”.
