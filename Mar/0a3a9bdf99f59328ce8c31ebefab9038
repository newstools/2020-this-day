By George Okoh The Benue State Executive Council, (BESEC), has asked Governor Samuel Ortom to refrain from receiving visitors, especially those from outside the state. Benue State Commissioner for Education, Professor Dennis Tyavyar, disclosed this during an interview in Makurdi, the state capital. He said the move was aimed at protecting the state governor from contacting the Coronavirus disease which has posed a grave danger worldwide. Professor Tyavyar also informed that all forms of communication with the governor would henceforth be carried out through telephone. “We have also, as Execute Council, even advised the state governor not to see many people, especially those coming from other places. “And the government of Benue State would usually be asking questions on telephone. If you want to discuss with the governor, you can call him and talk to him, and only in very rare cases will people be in contact with him. That is what we have advised,” the commissioner emphasised. The commissioner, however, did not disclose the dedicated numbers to reach out to the governor for both internal and external visitors as well as the duration of his public contact restrictions. In a related development, Benue State Commissioner for Health and Human Services, Dr. Sunday Ongbabor, has said that the state is working closely with the National Centre for Disease Control to be on alert in the event that any of those in contact with the positive cases in the country have made their way into the state. He said surveillance against Coronavirus had been stepped up and advised the people to avoid shaking hands and to observe personal hygiene such as frequently washing their hands with soap
