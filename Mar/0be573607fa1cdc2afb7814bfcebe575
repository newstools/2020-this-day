Segun Awofadeji in Bauchi The Bauchi State Government has shut down all markets across the state with effect from March 26 (today). The Chairman of the State Outbreak Response Committee on Lassa Fever and COVID-19, Senator Baba Tela announced this wednesday while briefing journalists at the Government House, Bauchi. The state deputy governor said the move was part of government’s efforts to minimise social interaction over the pandemic. “This directive is in line with the earlier decision of the State Government, which had restricted any gathering that is more than 50 people. “Pharmacies, sellers of food items, super markets selling essential products, filling stations and Bakeries are to remain open but they should adhere strictly to the instructions given on environmental cleanliness and hygiene to reduce the spread of the virus.” He enjoined officials of the State Chapter, National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) to direct their members to observe the rules on passengers of not more than three people per vehicle. He also advised them to provide hand sanitisers to their passengers by complying with the new policy of social-distancing, and called for the support of stakeholders to achieve the desired objectives. The chairman added that the committee has since sent request to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control for an approval to purchase treatment kits. He therefore appealed to the citizens of the state to provide the committee with the needed information for immediate action. Tela therefore assured citizens of the state of the readiness and determination of the state government to strengthen the capacity of its medical personnel to deal with emergency.
