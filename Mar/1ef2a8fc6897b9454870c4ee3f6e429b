As sports enthusiasts anticipate the 20th National Sports Festival tagged Edo 2020, the Nigeria Television Authority (NTA) and its marketing partner, HotSports have announced live transmission of the games. The live transmission on NTA network services will spice up the festival, which opens in Benin City on March 22 and runs till April 1. Edo 2020 will feature 32 sports, including 27 compulsory events, and have 11,000 athletes competing for laurels at 17 venues. According to the President/CEO of HotSports Nigeria Limited, Mr Taye Ige, marketing windows that interested brands could explore include three-hour live transmission of each of the opening and closing ceremonies, two-hour daily live transmission, live transmission of the football and athletics finals as well as a well-packaged one-hour daily highlights show. “The National Sports Festival is our national asset, and this being an Olympic year, we must all rally behind our athletes to deliver great results and be ready to win medals in Tokyo 2020,” Ige said. NTA and HotSports both delivered all the matches of last year’s Africa Cup of Nations live from Egypt as well as the qualifiers for the next edition. The two partners, in conjunction with African International Television (AIT), also broadcast the international friendly between Nigeria and Brazil last October. The trio are set to conclude live transmission of the remaining four matches of the Super Eagles for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, scheduled to hold in Cameroon next January.
