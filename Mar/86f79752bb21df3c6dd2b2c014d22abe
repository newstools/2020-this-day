Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, who broke the news to THISDSAY last night, said the Italian tested negative to the virus twice and was thus allowed to go home. On the same day, the Nigerian government announced the inclusion of Austria and Sweden on the list of countries affected by the coronavirus travel ban, while the Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, stated that the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos and the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja might eventually be shut, as part of measures to contain the virus.

He is now clean of the virus,” the governor told THISDAY. The Italian, Nigeria’s index case of coronavirus, flew into the country from Milan on February 24. He had lodged at a hotel close to Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Ikeja, Lagos, before moving to Ewekoro in Ogun state, the next day, for a job at the cement company in the town. He fell sick on the third day of his stay in the country and tested positive for the disease two days after. In total, 10,080 deaths have been reported, most of them in Europe (4,932) and Asia (3,431). Italy is the worst affected country with 4,032 fatalities, followed by China with 3,248, the initial epicentre of the outbreak, and Iran with 1,433. The virus can cause respiratory failure, particularly in the elderly. The number of infections and deaths in the rest of the world has surpassed those in China, which appears to have staunched the virus with strict measures including a complete quarantine of Wuhan since January. As the toll surged in Italy, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said the national lockdown, which had been copied around Europe, would be extended beyond April 3. Italy yesterday reported a record 627 new deaths from coronavirus and saw its world-leading toll surpass 4,000 despite government efforts to stem the pandemic’s spread. The Mediterranean country’s daily death rate is now higher than that officially reported by China at the peak of its outbreak around Wuhan’s Hubei province. Italy’s previous one-day record death toll was 475 on Wednesday. Italy has seen more than 1,500 fatalities from COVID-19 in the past three days alone. It has now recorded the five highest one-day tolls officially registered around the world. Italy’s total number of deaths now stands and 4,032. Infections rose by nearly 6,000 to 47,021. The nation of 60 million currently accounts for 36.6 per cent of the world’s coronavirus deaths. “There are so many people walking around who have the virus and who are at risk of infecting others,” Matteo Bassetti, the director of the infectious diseases department at Genoa’s San Martino clinic, told Italy’s AGI news agency. “The 40,000 cases we are talking about could actually be 100 times higher.” The Italian government intends to extend a ban on public gatherings and the shutdown of almost all businesses past their March 25 deadline. Regional leaders and city mayors are urging the Italian government to adopt even tougher restrictions such as a ban on outdoor exercises and the closure of all stores on Sundays. France also mooted extending its two-week lockdown ordered this week by President Emmanuel Macron, as the interior minister blasted “idiots” who flout home confinement rules and put others at risk.

Lagos, Abuja Airports Will Be Shut Later The Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, yesterday in Abuja said even though the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos and Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja might not be shut immediately, the two airports would eventually be shut someday. Sirika who made the submission while speaking with State House reporters after a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari, said other international airports in the country would be shut today in enforcement of the travel ban placed on countries with huge volume of COVID-19. Asked why the Lagos and Abuja airports with the highest volume of international flights would not be shut in the face of the rapid spread of COVID-19 across the world, he said the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 had the responsibility to take the best decision, reiterating however, that all the airports would yet be shut at a given time. “Well I think differently, this is my individual perspective. At some points these airports must be closed, this is my opinion. But like I said, there is Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 to which I am a member. “But certainly and definitely at some point, these airports must be closed (Abuja and Lagos), all of them in Nigerian will be closed. I think it is the safest thing to do because these things, they multiply exponentially. Earlier in the day, President Muhammadu Buhari reiterated the commitment of his administration to the welfare of Nigerians especially over the spread of COVID-19 around the world. A statement by presidential spokesman, Malam Garba Shehu, said the president noted that protecting Nigerian citizens from the disease was the federal government’s priority.

What I advise the community is that this drug has significant side effects. It is not a drug that you should use without medical supervision. ‘’We are also extremely prepared and capable of containing the threat that the Coronavirus represents.
