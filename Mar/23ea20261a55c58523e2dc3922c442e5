By Tobi Soniyi Some stakeholders and concerned members of the University of Lagos, Akoka, have appealed to the Vice Chancellor, Prof. Toyin Ogundipe and the Chairman of the university’s Governing Council, Dr. Wale Babalakin (SAN) and their supporters to sheathe their swords. In a statement they issued at the weekend, the group, which comprises academic and none academic staff of the university, warned that it was in the interest of the institution, the staff and the students for peace to reign in the university. While hoping that higher authorities would intervene, they pleaded with the warring parties not to do anything that would further aggravate the crisis. The relationship between the pro-chancellor and the chairman of council recently turned sour, the fall out of which was the suspension of the university’s convocation initially slated to start from Monday, March 9, till Friday, March 13, 2020. While the Governing Council of the university blamed the vice-chancellor for the suspension of the 56th convocation ceremonies of the institution, Ogundipe denied any wrong doing saying that all his actions were based on precedent.
The stakeholders said: “Against all the reasonable moves and efforts rallied at tackling the lingering issue, the university community has, sadly, been polarized into either Pro-Ogundipe or Pro-Babalakin camps, with intrigues of mistrust and victimisation of opposing camps.
“The polarisation got worsened with one of the unions strongly disparaging first, the Office of the Registrar in 2019, and currently (2020) the Chairman of Council and Pro-Chancellor.
