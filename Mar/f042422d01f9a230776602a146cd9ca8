Saipem Contracting Nigeria Limited has debunked the allegation circulating on social media platforms that the Italian infected by coronavirus in Nigeria visited the firm’s office in Banana Island, Lagos, and that the firm is now on lockdown. In a statement by Saipem’s Managing Director, Mr. Walter Peviani, said the Italian had never been to its premises, adding that it is continuing with its operations normally. Peviani said in the statement that: “As confirmed by the Deputy Governor of Lagos State, Mr. Obafemi Hamzat, on national television channels, this person visited Ewekoro in Ogun State before he fell ill and was brought to Lagos where he was diagnosed with the COVID-19. “In addition, other press briefings and statements by the Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, and the Minister of Health, Dr. E. Osagie Ehanire, have confirmed the itinerary of the patient. So he never visited our premises.”
