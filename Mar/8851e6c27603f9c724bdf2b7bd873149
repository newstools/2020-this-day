The Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Mr. Festus Keyamo (SAN), has claimed that the COVID-19 pandemic is being used by God to teach humanity a lesson. Keyamo said this in a tweet late on Wednesday. The minister asked Nigerians to seize the opportunity to ask God for forgiveness, adding that he will intervene. He added, “God has allowed COVID-19 to afflict the human race only to redirect our steps back to Him. We have so distorted God’s word to suit our own human weaknesses and satisfy our greed, even in supposed holy places. We should collectively ask for forgiveness and it will all end in praise. “Aside the spiritual angle to this scourge, we must all work and pray; God can only help those who help themselves. Those recalcitrant pastors must realise this. “All the directives of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control must be followed to the letter by all and sundry before it can quickly end in praise.”
