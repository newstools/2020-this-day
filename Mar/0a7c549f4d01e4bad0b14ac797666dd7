By Onyebuchi Ezigbo The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has ordered its members to embark on a two-week warning strike with immediate effect. The National Executive Committee of the union met Monday in Enugu and decided to embark on the warning to protest what they described as a move to stop the payment of their February salary by the federal government. Speaking in a telephone interview with THISDAY shortly after their NEC meeting in Enugu, ASUU President, Prof. Biodun Ogunyemi, said the union asked all its members to immediately proceed on a two-week warning strike to enable them sort out issues relating to the February salary presumed to have been barred by government over non-compliance with the registration into the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS).
