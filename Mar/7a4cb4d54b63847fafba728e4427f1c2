David Beckham will reportedly offer David Silva a big money salary in a bid to tempt the Manchester City midfielder to join Inter Miami this summer. Silva will be a free agent once his contract has expired at City in June, bringing to an end a 10-year, trophy-laden stay at the Etihad. Despite turning 34 in January, Silva is likely to receive offers from a host of top clubs this summer, with MLS teams sure to be among them. According to the Daily Mirror, Beckham wants to add Silva’s quality and experience to an inexperienced Miami side playing just their first season in MLS. The club signed a host of largely unknown players to form their first ever team but have lost their opening two games by narrow margins. As a result, Beckham sees Silva as a player who could help his youngsters over the coming months, once football returns following the coronavirus suspension.

The former England captain also believes the Spaniard is the sort of figurehead who could excite Miami’s hispanic community and continue their impressive support so far. Back in December it was reported in The Sun that Silva was close to agreeing a move to Miami and become their first big name signing. However, the latest reports suggest a move to the US is still some distance away but Miami remain hopeful of convincing him to join the club. Silva is currently the longest serving player at City and will bring the curtain down on a glittering decade at the club that has yielded four Premier League titles and two FA Cups when he departs.
