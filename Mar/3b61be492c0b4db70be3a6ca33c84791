By Goddy Egene It was a gloomy week for stock investors globally as the Coronavirus fears and slump in crude oil price push markets to their worst weekly performance since 2008 financial crisis. In Nigeria, the risk-off approach by some investors and panic dumping by others led to decline of N1.8 trillion in capitalisation, while the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) All-Share Index dipped by 13.49 per cent to close at N11.847 trillion and 22,733.35 respectively. Consequently, the year-to-date (YTD) decline has plunged to 15.3 per cent. The market recorded an unprecedented decline from Monday to Thursday before posting a marginal appreciation on Friday. Although the value and volume of trading was higher compared to the previous week, all the sectors tracked closed negatively with the NSE Banking Index falling the most by 26.2 per cent.
The NSE Consumer Goods Index shed 14.8 per cent, while NSE Oil & Gas Index depreciated by 8.5 per cent. The NSE Insurance Index went down by 5.7 per cent, just as the NSE Industrial Good Index lost 5.4 per cent. According to analysts at Cordros Capital, they see further decline in stock prices going forward. “Looking ahead, we still see sizeable legroom for further downslide in risk assets as investors continue to run towards safety in the face of the precipitous decline in oil price,” they said. All the markets tracked in Africa were in red with the Kenya NSE 20 losing 11.5 per cent. Mauritius’ SEMDEX and Morocco’s Casablanca MASI indices slipped 8.0 per cent and 8.3 per cent respectively just as Egypt’s EGX 30 and Ghana’s GSE Indices dipped by 8.1 per cent and 0.1 per cent in that order. In the BRICS market, Brazil’s Ibovespa Index led the laggards, falling by 22.2 per cent just as Russia’s RTS Index went down by a 21.2 per cent . In South Africa, the FTSE/JSE index lost 15.1 per cent, while India’s BSE Sens and China’s Shangai Composite Indices remained unchanged. Markets in Asia and the Middle East, were equally bearish posting the heaviest losses. Thailand’s SET Index recorded a 17.3 per cent fall followed by UAE’s ADX General and Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul ASI Indices that declined 15.5 per cent and 14.9 per cent in that order. Qatar’s DSM 20 and Turkey’s BIST 100 indices shed 11.6 per cent and 12.8 per cent in order. The advanced markets were not spared from the rampaging bears with the Germany’s XETRA DAX Index suffering the highest loss of 20.4 per cent. In France, the CAC 40 index shed 20.1 per cent. In the same vein, UK’s FTSE All-Share Index slipped 17.3 per cent. In the US, NASDAQ and S&P 500 indices fell 13.5 per cent and 15.2 per cent in that order. However, Japan and Hong Kong, the Nikkei 225 and Hang Seng were flat. While the slump in prices was sending panic among most investors, the Chairman of Association of Securities Dealing Houses of Nigeria (ASHON), Chief Oyinyechukwu Ezeagu, believe investors should see the decline as an opportunity to increase their portfolios. Ezeagu said rather than panic, investors should take advantage of the bearish trend to increase their investments in stocks, noting that the market would soon stabilize and bounce back. Although ASHON acknowledged the high level of downswing on the market in the last couple of days, it stated that fundamentals of the quoted companies remained strong. Responding to media enquiries, ASHON’s Chairman, Chief Oyinyechukwu Ezeagu explained that Nigeria’s stock market remained part of the global exchanges and as such any development in the global market would impact on its operations. “The effect of the coronavirus is gradually affecting trading all over the world and whatever happens elsewhere reflects in our market. The centre of it all is China and being a major world power both in productive and consumption capacities, any ill wind affecting China would naturally cause a big sneezing to the rest of world. Investors should not panic. The share prices will bounce back. The companies’ fundamentals remain strong. Many investors are taking advantage of the bearish run to beef up their portfolios,” said Ezeagu. Commenting on why the market had in the early part of the first quarter enjoyed rally only to be moderated by prolonged bearish trend, Ezeagu said: “There were a lot of positive policy pronouncement which influenced investors’ perception, hence the rally. These are attributable to the policy of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) on Open Market Operation (OMO) Bills, the new national budget cycle, the expectations of members on the outcome of the demutualisation of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) and generally the traditional optimism following a new year which was our own January effect.
