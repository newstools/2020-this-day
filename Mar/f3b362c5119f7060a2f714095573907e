Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja The Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr. Yekini Nabena, has said he has taken over from Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu as the spokesman of the party, though in acting capacity. But in a swift reaction, Issa-Onilu said that Nebena was chasing shadows, adding that he remains the spokesperson of the party. A Sokoto High Court had last week restrained APC from appointing or electing “Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu or any member” into its top positions except through a National Convention. Nabena, in a statement issued on Sunday in Abuja, claimed that his assumption of office was with the understanding of Issa-Onilu pending the time he would sort out the court matter. He stated: “APC is a law abiding party and as leaders of the party, we must be seen doing the right thing at all time, including respecting the order of the court. In lieu of this, Mallam Onilu has begun the process of vacating the order of the Sokoto High Court restraining him but pending the time this will be done, I will act in his position. “Unlike the former ruling party, APC has high regard for the judiciary and we must be seen at all time at practicing what we preach.” Nabena however assured media representatives of his prompt responses to enquiries and clarifications while creating mutual understanding between the public and the ruling party. But Issa-Onilu, while responding through a text message, said no court ruling has restrained him from being the National Publicity Secretary of the party. According to him, “There’s no any such court judgment restraining me. He’s chasing shadows. I’ll speak to it soon.”
