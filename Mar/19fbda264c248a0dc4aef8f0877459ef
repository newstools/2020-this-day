Allegations by some members of Onitsha Bridgehead Drug Market that fake drug dealers had taken over the market has unsettled traders there. A group in the market, Concerned Committee of Friends had on Monday raised allegation that there were plans by fake drug dealers to hijack the election in the market and install one of its own. But leaders and traders at the market have denied the allegations, saying that that since after Prof. Dora Akunyili-led National Agency for Food Drug Administration and Control, NAFDAC closed the market in 2007, there had been no case of sale of fake drug in the market. Chairman of the Market Mr. Anthony Ezioba and the Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Mr. MaryChaplet Igboameze who spoke to THISDAY in Onitsha called on Governor Willie Obiano and the police to investigate the allegation and make the accusers to produce those fake drug dealers in the market. Ezioba stated that, “Since 2007 when the market was shut down by NAFDAC over alleged fake drugs, the market was rid- of fake drugs and unwholesome products. The leadership of the market since then had maintained sanity in the market without looking at faces or who was involved. “Between December 26 and December 29, 2019 the leadership of the market handed over nine trucks of expired drugs to the NAFDAC which were willingly brought to their office by the traders due to long lasting agreement and understanding with the agency to sustain the sanity in the market.” Ezioba warned politicians in the market to desist from using very sensitive matters as their campaign strategy that would create unnecessary tension in the market, stressing that NAFDAC has waded into the matter to ascertain the truth of the fake drug dealers in the market.
