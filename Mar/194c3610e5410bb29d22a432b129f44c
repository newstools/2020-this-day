To strengthen the national response to COVID-19 in Nigeria, the Founder of BUA Group, Alhaji Abdul Samad Rabiu, has announced a donation of 1billion in cash through the BUA Foundation and has also placed an order for an additional donation of equipment and medical supplies, including testing kits and medical protective gear to nine states in Nigeria. These medical supplies are being airfreighted and will arrive Nigeria as soon as possible. States to benefit include: Lagos, Kano, Adamawa, Edo, Kwara, Rivers, Abia, Akwa-Ibom and Sokoto. Speaking on the donation, Rabiu said that it was very important for the private sector to support the government’s effort to curb the spread of the virus, while also adding that the N1billion donation will be done through the Central Bank of Nigeria-led “Private Sector Coalition Committee against COVID-19”. “This donation will not only provide additional needed funds to the government and NCDC’s efforts but will also serve to protect healthcare and medical workers on the frontlines of fighting the pandemic. In addition to donating the ordered medical supplies and equipment to the two most populated states in Northern and Southern Nigeria, we have also selected seven states across all geopolitical regions in Nigeria where significant members of the BUA workforce and their families are situated to help preparedness and response to the challenges posed by the pandemic. Each of these nine states will receive about 100,000 protective facemasks, 1000 high-grade medical protection and isolation gear, 2,000 protective goggles, 1,000 gloves and 1,000 testing kits amongst other things.” Rabiu added
