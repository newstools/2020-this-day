The Nigerian Council of Registered Insurance Brokers (NCRIB) has described as unfortunate the recent fire disaster that occurred at Abule Ado in Lagos State through which 20 lives were lost and properties destroyed. President of the Council, Mrs. Bola Onigbogi, in a statement said the fire incident which was reportedly caused by an explosion of the NNPC gas pipeline in the area was another disaster and the council sympathises with those who lost their loved ones to the unfortunate incident. Onigbogi, opined that, “at a time like this, the heart of our Council and the entire members go after those who lost their beloved families and valuables in the inferno.” She said the incident also provided a platform to underscore the pivotal place of insurance in risk mitigation and control, particularly through insurance. The NCRIB President commended Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, for setting up a N2 billion relief fund to address emergency needs of those affected.
She, however, said insurance is a business setup for other businesses to thrive, adding that a payment of little premium to insurance industry could have taken off the burden from the state government. According to Onigbogi, in other climes, insurance normally provide succor to people in the event of adversity occasioned by loss of lives and properties such as the case at hand. She, however, noted that Nigerians were yet to embrace insurance and give it priority.
