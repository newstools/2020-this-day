Announcing the sad news, he said: “I’m broken. Just lost my beautiful wife to cancer. She was my best friend for 43 years and my wife for 41 years. Cancer is real, but it shouldn’t be a death sentence – awareness, and early detection and treatment are key to survival. I miss her so so much. I’m broken. “Our children are devastated, I am too. But I have to be strong for them. Please put our family in your prayers. Like the sun, my wife was a blessing and touched the lives of everyone she met. “Though she’s gone, she’d remain alive in our hearts forever. ‪I miss you, my sweetheart, and my most beautiful girl, Evelyn Murray-Bruce. Forever yours”
