Iran is battling the worst COVID-19 pandemic in the Middle East region, with at least 2, 378 persons said to have died since the outbreak started in the country. The Special Adviser to the Health Ministry, Ali Reza Vahabzadeh said on Friday that the virus had killed another 144 people in the country, pushing the death toll to 2,378 amid 32,332 confirmed cases. Authorities have urged people to stay home but have not imposed the sweeping lockdown seen elsewhere in the region. Iranian officials have repeatedly insisted they have the outbreak under control despite concerns it could overwhelm the countryâ€™s health facilities.
