Daji Sani in Yola The Adamawa State Government has stated that it could not pay the March salaries using the new consequential adjustment agreed upon and dully signed by Organised Labour Unions. The Director General for Media and Communications to the State Governor, Mr Solomon Kumangar made the statement wednesday while addressing journalists at the Yola Government House. Kumangar attributed the inability of the state government to implement the new consequential adjustment to the economic crunch imposed by the global pandemic COVID-19. “Government cannot implement the consequential adjustment for senior workers but workers at level one to level six in the state have started receiving March Salary alerts with N32,000 minimum wage,” he said. He said the government attention has been drawn to the misunderstanding and misconception that trailed the earlier statement issued by government regarding the payment of March salaries without the consequential adjustment it agreed to and signed with organised labour unions The director general assured that the State Governor, Mr. Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri, has promised to pay the consequential adjustment with the backlog of salaries arrears as soon as global oil prices stabilised and nation’s earnings picks up. However the State Chairman of Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Mr. Emmanuel Fashe, told THISDAY that the state governor consulted with the labour union before the statement was issued. Fashe appealed to workers to remain calm because the backlog of their salaries would be paid once situations improved.
