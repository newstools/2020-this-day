Sylvester Idowu in Warri As the COVID-19 continues to ravage the country, the Chairman of Warri South Local Government Area, Dr. Michael Tidi, has cautioned the management of Nigeria Ports Authority (NPA), the Nigeria Navy, Nigeria Customs Service and other relevant federal government agencies not to allow ships from high risk countries affected by the virus berth in Warri Port. Tidi, in a statement recently stressed that the warning became necessary following reports that majority of the COVID – 19 cases confirmed in Nigeria were imported. He maintained that the complete closure of the country’s land borders by the federal government as part of measures to check the Coronavirus pandemic, made it more imperative for the authorities to properly screen ships entering the country through the maritime borders. The Council Boss advised people of the oil rich Warri South Local Government Area not to entertain any fear, assuring that his government has put all necessary machinery in place to prevent the virus in the area. He appealed to residents to place high premium on personal hygiene and be alive to the policy on social distance as it affects people with suspected health situations.
