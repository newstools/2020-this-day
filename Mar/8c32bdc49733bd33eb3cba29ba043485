The Slum Art Foundation, as part of its corporate social responsibility (CSR) project that focuses on mentoring, restructuring mindsets and developing the creative talents of children living within slums, recently held an exhibition and painting session with the kids in the slum to commemorate the #MyFreedomDay. According to a statement, the event held at the Ijora Badia area of Lagos. The event themed: #Paintingwiththegoodguys, was graced by the Commander of Rapid Response Squad (RRS), DCP Tunji Disu, and his team who were shown the various art works done by the children as they collaborated in painting various art works in marking the globally celebrated day. According to a statement, the global campaign against modern slavery championed by CNN is one that spread across six continents and 100 countries and over the years seen the participation of students globally through creative expressions call for an end to all forms of modern slavery. Speaking at the event, Co-founder, Slum Art Foundation, Adetunwase Adenle, stated that the scourge of modern day slavery was one which requires the full attention and deliberate efforts of not just the government, but every stakeholder, influencers and members of every household within every society in putting an end to the global issue. He urged parents to be supportive of their wards, encourage them to enjoy their childhood memories with friends and empower them with skills that would make them better persons for themselves and their community rather than saddle them with the responsibilities of being involved in trading on the streets of Lagos at a young age which is unsafe. “At Slum Art foundation, we are able to provide a conducive learning environment and platform for children in the slum to acquire skills in art, thereby taking them off the streets after school and empowering them to be more useful members of our society. “The positive impact on our engagement is the multiplier effect of having the friends of children actively engaged in the training sessions also come around and joining them, thus keeping them busy rather than engaging in illicit activities.” Adetunwase added.
