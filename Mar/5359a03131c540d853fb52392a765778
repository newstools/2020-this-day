He is chasing shadows, says Issa-Onilu By Adedayo Akinwale The Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr. Yekini Nabena, yesterday claimed that he has taken over from Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu as the spokesman of the party, though in acting capacity. But in a swift reaction, Issa-Onilu said that Nabena was chasing shadows, as there was no such court ruling. A Sokoto High Court had last week restrained APC from appointing or electing “Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu or any member” into its top positions except through a National Convention. Nabena in a statement issued yesterday in Abuja, claimed that his assumption of office was with an understanding with Issa-Onilu, pending the time he would sort out the court matter. He stated: “APC is a law abiding party and as leaders of the party we must be seen doing the right thing at all time, including respecting the order of the court. In lieu of this, Mallam Onilu has begun the process of vacating the order of the Sokoto High Court restraining him but pending the time this will be done, I will act in his position. “Unlike the former ruling party, APC has high regard for the judiciary and we must be seen at all times to practice what we preach,” Nabena stated. Nabena however assured media representatives of his prompt responses to enquiries and clarifications while creating mutual understanding between the public and the ruling party. But Issa-Onilu while responding through a text message said no court ruling was restraining him as the National Publicity Secretary of the party. According to him, “There’s no any such court judgment restraining me. He’s chasing shadow. I’ll speak to it soon.”
