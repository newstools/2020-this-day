The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has released another batch of results of about 450, 000 312 candidates that sat for the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME). JAMB’s Head of Media and Information, Dr. Fabian Benjamin, disclosed this yesterday in a statement. He urged candidates who sat for the examination on Tuesday to check their results by sending ‘RESULT’ to 55019 and not on the board’s website. Benjamin said the board has not cancelled the results of its examination conducted last Saturday as being speculated on the social media.
He explained that the results of the first day of the examination were placed on its website and that some fraudulent individuals were coping and manipulating it to deceive unsuspecting candidates. The JAMB spokesperson noted that this made the board to move the result to the mobile platform for candidates to use “their unique phone numbers used in registering for the examination to access their results.” He therefore, urged the candidates to disregard rumours making the rounds that the results have been cancelled.
The statement reads: “The result of the over 450,000 candidates who sat on Tuesday will also be released before 12noon Wednesday.
“To check their results, candidates are to send ‘RESULT’ to 55019 and not on the board’s website. “We urge the public to always cross check information provided on social media. “Results of the examination will continue to be released as examination is taken. In few days from now, we will be concluding the 2020 exercise and we urge all candidates to be vigilant as many fraudsters who couldn’t operate successfully given the security measures put in place to secure our system will want to use every opportunity of information gap to defraud or mislead unsuspecting candidates.”
