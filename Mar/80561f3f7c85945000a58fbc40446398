Femi Solaja The 10th edition of the South East Cricket championship tagged ‘Chuma Anosike Cup’ will feature six male and female teams as the landmark edition promises to be colourful and exciting for participants, officials and spectators. At the briefing to herald the commencement of this year’s edition, the promoter of the competition and Former Vice President, Nigeria Cricket Federation, Barrister Chuma Anosike said this year’s tournament will hold in Awka, the Anambra state capital from March 11th to 15th. Anosike who is also the Chairman of Anambra Cricket Association explained that the tournament has achieved so much despite the challenges faced in the course of growing the game in the zone through the competition. “When we started in 2011, only three states; Imo, Enugu and Anambra took part and there was no female participation. It was at the third edition that Abia and Ebonyi joined. To the glory of God we’ve been able to move the tournament round the states and that is one of the fundamental objectives, to ensure that all the states host the event. “We’ve actually done all the state and we are doing the third round now. A number of the objectives we set out to achieve has been attained, the game has continued to grow but not as popular as football but it’s definitely increasing in popularity.” While commending sponsors, officials and participants for making the tournament a toast of the South East and pride of Nigerian cricket, Anosike stated that there is still a lot to do in developing the game in the region while hoping that the stakeholders will work together to achieve more.
