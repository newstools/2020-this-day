The Group Managing Director/CEO of Access Bank Plc, Mr. Herbert Wigwe had last November that the financial institution had been delivering robust performance in post merger, despite a challenging and fast-changing macro and banking landscape. According to him, this further reinforces the bank’s sustainable business model and brand promise to deliver more to all stakeholders as we work to realise the envisioned synergies of merger. He said the deliberate investments in expanding its digital lending portfolio resulted in higher daily volume disbursement, putting Access Bank in the forefront of digital lending. “Going into the last quarter of the year, our focus remains on consolidating our retail momentum and driving financial inclusion. Furthermore, we will remain disciplined in our efforts to deliver enhanced shareholders’ value,with a focus on offering more than banking,” Wigwe had said.
