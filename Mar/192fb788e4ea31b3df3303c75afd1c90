Bennett Oghifo The federal government Saturday said it would reopen the outbound lane at the Ojodu-Berger-end of the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway to vehicular traffic this morning. The Minister of Works and Housing, Mr. Babatunde Fashola stated this saturday through his Special Assistant on Media, Mr. Hakeem Bello, who inspected the work done by the contractor, Julius Berger Plc. The federal government had reconstructed the 600 metres of bad road between Ojodu Berger and the mouth of the Kara Bridge. Reconstruction of this stretch began on Monday September 2, last year. Federal Controller of Works in Lagos, Adedamola Kuti, who conducted the inspection yesterday, said the inbound stretch was completed in December, last year and opened to traffic. The outbound 600 metres stretch opened today will ease traffic considerable on the Lagos-end of the expressway, particularly because it was designed and built to withstand the axle load of heavy duty trucks going in and out of Lagos daily. Kuti said the road would eventually have a weigh bridge to check the tonnage it carries to ensure it does not deteriorate before the end of its lifespan, which he said was not expected to be less than 25 years. He said, “By the first week of March, we should be able to open the Magboro stretch to traffic.” He said some stretches at Ibafo has been completed and that by the end of the first week of April, they should be able to complete work on the Mowe axis, stating that by the time this was done, work would have been completed on 31 to 32 kilometers out of the 43 kilometres of the road. He said all things considered, “before the end of 2021, we would have completed the entire stretch. So, what will be left for us will be the old toll gate in Lagos to this Berger junction. He said more work would be done in 2022 in the area of toll plaza, under pass, flyovers, and the interchange, but that “the main carriageway will be completed by the end of December 2021.”
