Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja The House of Representatives has called on the federal government to arrest and prosecute anyone avoiding COVID-19 screening at the nation’s airports. The Chairman, House Committee on Media and Public Affairs, Hon. Benjamin Kalu, stated this while reacting to the circular issued by the Chief of Staff to the President, Mr. Abba Kyari, alleging that some members of the House evaded screening at the airport. Kalu said the letter from Kyari was a wake-up call for all Nigerians, adding that the virus was real and should be taken seriously by all irrespective of status. “The truth is that it is unpatriotic for you not to pass through the screening. It is unpatriotic to the nation and such persons should be penalised. They should be arrested. Kalu added: “Those people who pass through there without screening should be arrested and be properly checked before being released so that we don’t allow anyone who has this virus into circulation. We don’t even know who has this virus right now and so, we have to take extra care. “There is a screening process at the airport that is supposed to be obeyed by every patriotic citizen of this country irrespective of your status. It doesn’t matter if you are whether you are the President of the country, a Senator or a member of the House or a governor. “Health is very important. If yours is not important to you, that of others is important to them and any negligent act by being careless might affect a whole lot of Nigerians.”
