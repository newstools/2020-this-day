In line with the 2020 International Women’s Day (IWD), Wema Bank recently celebrated female staff and customers of the bank. Tagged “Generation Equality; Realising a Woman’s Right,” a statement disclosed that the interactive session drew from the IWD global theme ‘Each for Equal’ to discuss collective individualism as a notion in the drive for gender equality. “Inspired by the substantial role of women in the growth of its business, deliberations also addressed demands on equal pay, equal sharing of unpaid care and domestic work, an end to sexual harassment, all forms of violence against women and girls, healthcare services that respond to our needs, equal participation in politics and decision-making in all areas of life,” the statement added. The session also opened to customers, especially members of the bank’s women-support community, SARA by Wema. The event further promoted the SARA by Wema community which had empowered over 10,000 women since its launch in March 2019 through financial literacy programmes.
According to the Head of Brand and Marketing, Wema Bank, Funmilayo Falola, the event championed the discourse that we are all responsible for our thoughts and actions. “As a bank, we believe that we can actively choose to challenge stereotypes, fight bias, broaden perceptions, improve situations and celebrate women’s achievement. “Beyond celebrating the IWD, the bank is partnering with Afro-soul queen, Aramide to host Songversation with Aramide, a concert-style event that celebrates the achievement of women in Nigeria. The partnership will also see the bank support three women-owned businesses with N100,000 each,” she added.
