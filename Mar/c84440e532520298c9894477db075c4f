Who best to divulge your deepest secrets than a former ally? When Imo State governor, Hope Uzodinma, blamed the People’s Democratic Party for the travails of the All Progressives Congress chairman, Adams Oshiomole, it seemed like a far-fetched claim until you realise that Uzodinma was a member of the PDP not too long ago. Perhaps, he is only revealing secrets that he had been privy to in the past. However by this logic, the retort by PDP stalwart and Rivers State governor, Nyesom Wike, advising Uzodinma to hold his peace lest he reveals the skeletons in his closet, deserves more than fleeting attention. Wike minced no words when he accused Uzodinma of being a double-agent while in the PDP. “It is unfortunate that Senator Hope Uzodinma will have the temerity to make that false allegation,” WIke said. “Hope Uzodinma was an APC agent while he was in PDP. That was why APC used him as an agent to support Ali Modu Sheriff, but they failed.” But Wike wasn’t done. He lamented how unfortunate it is that people of “questionable character” are in government. “If Senator Uzodinma dares to make such false comments again about the PDP, we will tell the world about him.” What more do we need to know, apart from the fact that Uzodinma didn’t become senator nor governor through the ballot but rather by judicial pronouncements using contestable technicalities? Pray Governor Wike, please spill the beans and help rid our polity of “questionable” characters.
