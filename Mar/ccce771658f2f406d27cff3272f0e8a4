We have been engaging ourselves on video calls overtime. That is, the IOC, the Japanese government and the organisers are working hand – in – hand with the World Health Organisation (WHO) to put in place the best for our athletes, officials and guests that will be in Japan but the extent the covid 19 has gotten to is a major concern for all and sundry, hence the postponement,”observed Gumel.
