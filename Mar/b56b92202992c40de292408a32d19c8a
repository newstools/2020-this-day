Juventus and Argentina forward Paulo Dybala and former Italy captain Paolo Maldini have tested positive for coronavirus. In a message on his Instagram account, Dybala said he and his girlfriend both have the virus but were in good health. “Both Oriana and I have tested positive,” Dybala, 26, said. “Luckily we are in perfect conditions.” AC Milan technical director Maldini and his son Daniel both tested positive and a club statement said they “are well”. The club added that Daniel Maldini, 18, had been training with the AC Milan first team and that he and his father, 51, had spent two weeks in self-isolation at home and would remain in quarantine “until clinically recovered”. Dybala is the third Juve player to be confirmed to have the virus, following centre-back Daniele Rugani and France World Cup winner Blaise Matuidi. Dybala’s girlfriend Oriana Sabatini – an Argentine singer, actress and model – is the niece of former tennis player Gabriela Sabatini, the 1990 US Open champion. All domestic sporting activity in Italy has been suspended until at least 3 April.
