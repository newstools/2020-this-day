Deborah Erioluwapo Ajayi, founder and CEO of Omoshola’s Empire, just added another feather to her business cap with the official opening of a new outlet named Cloud 11 Unisex Salon located at Al Wasel Road, Dubai on February 23, 2020. Cross dressing internet celebrity Idris Okuneye also known as Bobrisky was on hand to cut the tapes to declare the outlet open. The salon which had earlier undergone some refurbishment and upgrading was officially declared open to clients. Ms. Ajayi, the CEO of Omoshola’s Empire, owners of Cloud 11 Beauty Salon reiterated her commitment to providing world class services in all their outlets. She assured that even though walk in customers would be attended to as if they were regulars, it’s good for clients to make prior appointments. According to her, this is because booking ahead always ensures that each client gets tailor-made custom treatments as a bonus package. Ajayi said appointments could be scheduled by calling the dedicated customer lines, sending an email or via direct messaging on any of their social media platforms. With the opening of Cloud 11 Salon, she said Omoahola’s Empire was now more situated to serve customers in Jumeirah and environs better. Noting that opening the new branch is to make certain customers in Dubai experience and enjoy the full benefits of their complete beauty care services, she said CLOUD 11 clients will be able to enjoy an exclusive personalised experience that is beyond cloud 7.
