President Muhammadu Buhari has commended Mr. Emeka Offor, President of Chrome Oil and Founder of Sir Emeka Offor Foundation over the distribution of books to schools and educational institutions in Nigeria and Africa. Buhari who spoke in Oraifite, Ekwusigo Local Government Area of Anambra State yesterday, during the 2020 book distribution exercise of the foundation said he was impressed, and hoped to support the foundation to continue to engage in the laudable project. The president who was represented by Minister of State for Education, Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, said, “Anambra was lucky to have a man like Emeka Offor, Nigeria was lucky to have him, but I think Africa is luckier. “He is a man who lives for humanity. Every governor is looking forward to this kind of help in their state. Emeka has accepted to help in the area of health and education. Every time you see ill-tempered people or ill-behaved people it is because of lack of the right education and only education can change that. We will support your work.” Sir Emeka Offor, founder of the foundation in his address said his drive to distribute books to schools was motivated by his quest to eradicate illiteracy, provide knowledge, give support to government in the improvement of infrastructure. He said, “What is significant about this year’s programme is the addition of medical equipment to the books. Books for this year will be distributed to 80 universities, 22 polytechnics, 180 public primary and secondary schools, 7 public libraries all across the six geo political zones of the state.”
