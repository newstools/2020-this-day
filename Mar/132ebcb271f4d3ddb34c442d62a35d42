A governorship aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Edo State, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, has hailed President Muhammadu Buhari; the National Leader of the governing party, Senator Bola Tinubu; APC governors and others for foiling the coup against the party’s National Chairman, Mr. Adams Oshiomhole. He stated this yesterday in Benin, while addressing Edo APC leaders and members who came to welcome him, upon his return from Abuja, where he went to solidarise with Oshiomhole, a former governor of the state. Ize-Iyamu said: “We are very grateful, as indigenes of Edo State, because we would have been ashamed and disappointed, if our son, Oshiomhole, was removed from office. “President Buhari, Senator Tinubu and other leaders of APC deserve commendation for foiling a coup, which was the product of a grand conspiracy, coordinated and funded from Edo State, for the removal as National Chairman of APC, an Edo son, Comrade Oshiomhole. “You can imagine a situation where few Edo indigenes were spending Edo people’s money to pay some persons to remove an eminent son of the state (Oshiomhole) as the National Chairman of APC.” The governorship aspirant also stated that members of the National Working Committee (NWC) and National Executive Committee (NEC), as well as the state chairmen of APC, including Edo chairman of the party, Col. David Imuse (rtd.), must also be commended for supporting Oshiomhole at the crucial period.
