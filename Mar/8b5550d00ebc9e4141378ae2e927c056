Omon-Julius Onabu in Asaba Gunmen have abducted a young man in Okpanam within the Delta State capital after allegedly eating the rice they forced the abductee’s wife to cook for them. The incident was said to have occurred while it was raining heavily in most parts of the state, including Okpanam in Oshimili North and neighbouring Asaba in Oshilmili South areas on Monday night. The wife of the kidnapped man, identified simply as Mrs Joseph, who narrated her ordeal claimed that all efforts to get the police for assistance was unsuccessful as the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) in charge of the local police station allegedly told her it was too late in the day. The woman, who said that she suspected the gunmen to be Fulani herdsmen because of their language, said their apartment in Graceland Estate in Okpanam was also ransacked by the criminals during the downpour, adding that they carted away her husband’s shoes, clothes, phones, ATM cards and her jewelry. She said that the gunmen came in through the window, which they asked the husband to open and then began to order them about at gun-point. “They brought my husband out under the rain and asked him to lie down and they took me inside and asked me to prepare rice for them which I did. Then they took all my husband shoes, clothes, phones, ATM Cards and all my jewelry. “I put a call across to the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) of Okpanam, but the DPO said that he could not come as it was already late.” The state Police spokeswoman, DSP Onome Onovwakpoyeya, confirmed the report yesterday and assured that the command had intensified efforts to rescue the victim safely.
