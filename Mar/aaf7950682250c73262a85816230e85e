Addressing a press conference in Abuja on Friday, the President of NMA, Dr. Francis Faduyile said: “In line with the above, we direct all medical association that have declared industrial actions against their management to suspend all actions as the national leadership of NMA shall take over the dispute and interact with the different organs and agencies of government.” The NMA president also charged doctors and other health professionals to ensure that they observe international best practice when treating patients. “As a professional body saddled with the responsibility of caring for humanity, we have taken into cognizance efforts being made by our government at different levels and we wish to commend their efforts so far. ”All medical personnel have been directed to respond positively to this national emergency. We call on all doctors in both private and public health facilities to be at their duty post to promptly treat Nigerians who reported to their hospitals,” he said.
