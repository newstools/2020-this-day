Chuks Okocha in Abuja The Vice Presidential Candidate of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mr. Peter Obi, has expressed concern over the plight of vulnerable and unemployed Nigerians whose survival is tied to their day-to-day activities. Obi, who spoke on the heels of the impending total lockdown of the country being announced by federal and state governments, said that appropriate measures should be taken to mitigate the suffering of the vulnerable ones in our midst while the governments implement all possible measures to stop the spread of the COVID-19. He noted that there are several millions of the people in the country who are either unemployed or underemployed and whose means of livelihood depends on daily income and asked the governments to come up with policy measures that would cushion the effects of the lockdown on them as being witnessed in other climes. Obi, who was the immediate past Governor of Anambra State, commended the efforts of some political leaders, captains of industry and corporate bodies toward containing the spread of the virus. According to him, “it would be counter-productive to keep only the elite in mind when taking such far-reaching decisions as closing down markets without having some cushioning measures for the traders.” He also said that elected public officials, especially the legislators, should be observing the stay-at-home directive in their constituencies in order to help their constituents in finding solutions to the challenges posed by the outbreak of COVID-19 and be able to advise government on how to address the fallouts of its policies. The former vice presidential candidate in the last election called on leaders in all segments of the society to make sacrifices and show commitment to the welfare of Nigerians at this critical period.
