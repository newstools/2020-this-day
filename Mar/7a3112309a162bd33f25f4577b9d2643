When he opened his law firm, Wole Olanipekun & Co., in 1980, after he was called to the Bar in 1976, he was determined to reach the zenith of the profession and also serve humanity in every humanly possible way. In 1991, about 11 years after, Olanipekun was conferred with the Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) which further proved his brilliance in the legal profession. In his 40 years of active practice, Olanipekun, a lawyer, solicitor, and activist par excellence, had won several cases, most of which were high profile, losing only a few here and there. In fact, he has proved his exceptional brilliance and shown uncommon competence in constitutional, pre and post-election dispute resolutions.
For this, he has handled a wide range of complex constitutional and election-related litigations for several governors and senators. But what his clear to all is that Olanipekun, a former President of the Nigerian Bar Association, NBA, is today a legal juggernaut, who is equally endowed with impressive elocution and oratorical power. Interestingly, Olanipekun, a former Pro-chancellor and Chairman, Governing Council of the University of Ibadan, has not only made his name in legal practice but also in philanthropy. Aware of the importance of education, Olanipekun, who is the Asiwaju of Ikereland, has sponsored hundreds of students through scholarships across the Yoruba nation. He is one successful man who is quick to admit that he owes God a lot of gratitude for all he has achieved in life; hence, he doesnâ€™t toy with his faith. Perhaps, this explains why top personalities recently gathered in the ancient town of Ikere during the dedication and consecration of Saint Peter Anglican Church ultra-modern auditorium, which he donated and handed over to Anglican Communion.
Some of the guests at the event included Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Ekiti State Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, and a former Head of State, Yakubu Gowon.
