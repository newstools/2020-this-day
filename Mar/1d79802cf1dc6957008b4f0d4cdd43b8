Following the suspension of sporting activities due to the Covid-19 pandemic across the world, MultiChoice recently announced plans to fill the void for its subscribers on DStv and GOtv across Africa through the broadcast of a variety of award-winning sport documentaries and sporting moments of all time. In a statement issued yesterday, the pay tv channel said that SuperSport 1 has been opened all the way to DStv Compact customers, who will have access to past sports stories that created some of sports most magical moments in history. Also, SuperSport 7 will showcase Motorsport action to all DStv Access customers. GOtv customers also have access to new content, with SuperSport Select 4 now available on GOtv JOLLI and Plus packages. Customers on these packages will have the opportunity of reliving epic matches of the Premier League. In addition, customers will have access to memorable WWE bouts on SuperSport Select 5. Live sports have suffered a notable impact globally as a result of sporting federations correctly prioritising the safety of players and fans alike, by adhering to accepted measures to limit the spread of the virus. In a statement issued by MultiChoice, the company stated that it has taken due care to ensure that its employees, customers, production houses and suppliers also have limited risk of exposure and will continue to update on programme schedules and changes in the coming days and weeks
