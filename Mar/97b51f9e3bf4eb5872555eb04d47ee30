Heir to the British throne, Prince Charles, has tested positive for coronavirus. His positive status was confirmed by Clarence House, according to Yahoo News. The Prince of Wales, 71, is in the government’s high risk category because of his age. A Clarence House spokesman said: “He has been displaying mild symptoms but otherwise remains in good health and has been working from home throughout the last few days as usual. “The Duchess of Cornwall has also been tested but does not have the virus. In accordance with Government and medical advice, the Prince and the Duchess are now self-isolating at home in Scotland. “The tests were carried out by the NHS in Aberdeenshire where they met the criteria required for testing. “It is not possible to ascertain from whom the Prince caught the virus owing to the high number of engagements he carried out in his public role during recent weeks.” The couple is understood to be self-isolating separately at Birkhall in Scotland.  (Yahoo News) Concerns for the heir apparent were raised last week when Prince Albert of Manaco became the first royal to test positive for the disease.
