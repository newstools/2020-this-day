By Alex Enumah The Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), on Sunday said he has nothing to do with the removal of Muhammadu Sanusi II as Emir of Kano and his subsequent banishment to Nasarawa State. Malami, in a statement by his media aide, Dr Umar Gwandu, said all those allegedly involved have been compiled and submitted before the court to decide, adding that he cannot comment on an issue that is currently before the court. “Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, SAN was not in any way connected with the dethronement of the former Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II and his subsequent banishment to Nassarawa State. “The issue of who does what over the dethronement saga has been effectively submitted for judicial determination. The matter is consequently sub judice. “Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice will not comment one way or the other over a matter that is pending before the court,” the statement read. Sanusi was on March 9 dethroned as Emir of Kano and was subsequently banished to Nasarawa State, where he stayed until March 13, 2020, before he travelled to Lagos a few hours after Justice Anwuli Chikere of the Abuja Division of the Federal High Court ordered his immediate release from the house arrest and confinement by security agencies.
