Chuks Okocha in Abuja The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has said it has noted the deposition of Emir Muhammad Sanusi II by the Kano state government at a time that the nation is battling worsening insecurity challenges, adding that it shows the insensitivity and poor appraisal of core national stability issues by the All Progressives Congress (APC) administration. Without prejudice to the issues, the PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, described the timing of the action of the Kano state government, particularly as it relates to a very sensitive traditional institution like the Emir of Kano stool, as a big political blunder coming at a time the country is wobbling under the siege of insecurity, especially in a state such as Kano. The PDP, however called for calm and circumspection from all quarters, especially, given the security and political stability concerns in the nation.
