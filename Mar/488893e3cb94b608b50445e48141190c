Speaking shortly after he was declared winner, Nehikhare told journalists that the election marked a new dawn for the party in the state, adding that the party is going to sit down to draw a strategy on how to move forward. “The difference is that we are going to do things better, faster, sharper and more people-oriented and focused. “It is a new dawn for the party and we are going to sit down and plan but don’t forget it is a new chairman, we are going to work according to his dictate. “His style may be different from that of Dan Orbih but we have to complement each other and make sure that Edo people respond to whatever message we give out”, he said. Meanwhile, the member representing Oredo Federal Constituency at the House of Representatives, Ogbeide Ihama, has called on all PDP faithful to work with the new leadership of the party to move it to greater heights especially now that the governorship election is fast approaching.
