Female staff of Linkage Assurance Plc have underscored the importance of harnessing the potential and abilities that rest with the women fold.
The staff said this in line with the World Women’s day recently celebrated worldwide. They noted that if the hidden abilities were explored, the feminine gender could add so much value to the economy and society at large.
Speaking on the theme, ‘Each for Equal,’ as part of the activities to mark the women’s day, the GM, Marketing, Linkage Assurance, Mrs. Joyce Ojemudia, called on the women staff to take advantage of the event and array of expert speakers brought together to redefine their career and launch themselves into higher responsibility in their professions. Ojemudia, also noted that it was important that women set goals, be focused, have clear vision, be committed to their visions, and take action.
“I will advise that we get your certifications and have mentors whom you can look up to for guidance and advice.” The speakers, while agreeing that women are disadvantaged in a number of ways including managing career and family, emphasised the importance of women overcoming the challenges to make success in their career. They also agreed that women should invest in every aspect of their lives, while also mastering the art of impression management, as that would give them the opportunity to be considered along their male counterparts for any position. On the theme of the conference, the speakers said it was apt and necessary to stimulate women to know that they are not inferior to men, and could achieve so much if the pursue their goals conscientiously.
Among the speakers at the event held in Lagos were Modupe Marc-Dawodu; Mr. Rajiv Sharma; Dr. Lekan Adelakun, and Mrs. Abi Longe.
