Five Serie A matches this weekend have been postponed because of coronavirus, including Juventus’ game at home to Inter Milan initially scheduled for today. Matches at Udinese, AC Milan, Parma and Sassuolo have also fallen victim to the outbreak of the virus in Italy. The games were initially going to be played behind closed doors, but Serie A took the decision Saturday to call them off. All five fixtures have been rescheduled for Wednesday, 13 May. As a consequence, the Coppa Italia final, which was scheduled for the same day, has been moved to the following week on Wednesday, 20 May – four days before the end of the domestic season. Four of this weekend’s five postponed fixtures were due to take place today. Italy has put towns in the north into lockdown after more than 300 people were infected, 12 of whom have died. It follows last weekend’s disruption when four Serie A games in Milan, Bergamo, Verona and Turin were suspended and Serie B side Cremonese drove 300 miles to Ascoli, only to be sent home upon arrival. Then on Thursday, Inter Milan’s Europa League victory over Ludogorets was played behind closed doors at San Siro Stadium. Yesterday, France announced a ban on indoor gatherings of more than 5,000 people to prevent the spread of the virus and today’s Paris half-marathon is cancelled – but football matches are not affected.
