Mary Nnah Fast growing kid artiste, little Oziomachukwu Favour Mojekwu a.k.a OzzyBosco, a multi-talented young Artiste, who at the tender age of four won the Nigeria “Kids Got Talent” recently turned a teenager with a new perception to life. Also known as OzzyBee, the young artiste’s perception changed to a more proactive approach to things around him as he now sees all monetary gifts to a child as seeds, and such seeds if not wasted but replanted will germinate and give rise to fruits that will yield multiple seeds. It was on the premise that the “UNESCO Child Advocate” awardee, a singer, dancer, actor, motivational speaker and a notable kid philanthropist who has touched many lives and put smiles on the faces of children, launched a Savings Culture Scheme for over 12 children between the ages of 3 to 17 years tagged OzzyBee Young Savers (OYS) Initiative. As a young Nigerian artiste with huge fan base, OzzyBee sees all his humanitarian projects as a way of giving back to the society. Therefore, the kick-off of the project, spearheaded by the OzzyBosco Smile Foundation (OSF) which is the Umbrella Body managing OzzyBee, has received the approval and support of Access Bank PLC and was held at one of their mainland branches. According to the artistes’ mother, Elizabeth Mojekwu, project is planned to be a continuous venture, adding that OzzyBee’s aim is to encourage the young people to cultivate the culture of early savings in in life. This she believes would help in developing that child into a prudent adult who would be financially responsible in his/her approach to life, noting that such child is most likely to be an asset and not a liability to their families or society at large. The OzzyBosco Smile Foundation would continue to contribute towards the growth of the account until the child attains the stipulated age of harvesting.
