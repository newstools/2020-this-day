Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja The Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Ibok-Ete Ibas, yesterday warned navy commanders against involvement in fraud and connivance with criminals. Speaking at a meeting with frontline naval commanders, some of whom were newly appointed, Vice Admiral Ibas said severe sanctions would be imposed for any act of indiscipline. He enjoined the commanding officers and commandants to acquaint themselves with the strategic directives of the CNS and relevant Nigerian Navy statutes guiding their various responsibilities. “He also cautioned that the service would impose severe sanctions for any act of indiscipline, fraud or connivance with criminals in the performance of their duties”, a statement signed by Navy Spokesman, Commodore Suleiman Dahun, said. Ibas submitted that sustained operational successes were dependent on an effective operational framework involving senior leadership, principal staff officers at the service headquarters, Flag Officers Commanding and resourceful frontline commanders. He warned that the practice of ratings solely bearing the brunt of misconduct would be discontinued, adding that commanders would be held responsible for the conduct of their men. The CNS further informed the commanders that they would be assessed periodically, assigned key performance indicators and would be expected to judiciously and legitimately deploy resources allocated to them. He urged the commanders to reinvigorate the Nigerian Navy divisional system towards effective management of men and their welfare. While congratulating the newly appointed commanders, commandants and commanding officers, Vice Admiral Ibas seized the opportunity to remind them that their appointment was in recognition of their potentials, hence, enjoined them to strive hard to uphold the image of the Nigerian Navy in all their endeavours.
