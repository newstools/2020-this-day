Victor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti The Ekiti State Government has met with the leadership of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) over the alleged flouting of order issued by the state Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, banning gathering more than 20 people in the state. The state Committee on CODIV-19 stated this in Ado Ekiti while speaking with journalists on the update on the progress made in taming the disease. The state Commissioner for Health, Dr. Mojisola Yaya-Kolade, who addressed journalists, said the meeting was convened to seek the partnership of the association on how best to enforce the order in all churches. Kolade added that bank executives have also put on alert on the need to guard against overcrowding of customers in the bank, saying this could jeopardise the fight against coronavirus. “We have met with the leadership of CAN and we made it clear to them that the order must be enforced. Very few churches complied last Sunday while some did well. “The committee also met with the leaders of ethnic groups like Hausa, Fulani, Ebira, Igbo and others, and we appealed to them to ensure that their members comply with this directive,” he said. The committee also warned sellers of sanitisers against indiscriminate hiking of prices, saying the brands in circulation should also be of good qualities to safeguard the health of the people. “They must not see this time as an opportunity to make money. We should be our brother’s keepers, and the sellers should ensure that sanitisers in circulation have 70 percent alcohol concentration.
