Barcelona have announced plans to reduce player and staff wages in a bid to “minimise the economic impact” caused by the coronavirus outbreak. Spanish football was suspended for an indefinite period earlier this month, with a resumption only taking place once the government and health bodies are satisfied there is no longer a risk to public health. With no sport possible and the subsequent effect on income streams, Barcelona announced on Thursday night they would be implementing measures in an attempt to reduce the economic impact of the crisis. Among the measures decided by the club’s board was “adapting the contractual obligations of the club staff to the new and temporary circumstances that we are experiencing”. A club statement read: “Basically it is a reduction of the working day, imposed by the circumstances and the protection measures carried out, and, as a consequence, the proportional reduction of the remuneration provided for in the respective contracts.”
According to Forbes, Messi could take Barca’s wage cut and still be among the top three highest-paid athletes in the world. He earns $90 million annually. Cutting the star winger’s pay by 70 per cent would save the club an estimated $50 million, which would more than cover its operating loss last year. The Barcelona forward is the highest-paid soccer player, earning $111 million and taking home $84 million in salary and winnings, and another $27 million in endorsements. Messi has a lifetime deal with Adidas. Other deals include Gatorade, Pepsi, and Huawei.
