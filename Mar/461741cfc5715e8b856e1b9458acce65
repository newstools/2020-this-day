Elizade University will host the 5th edition of the Nigerian Universities Golf Tour in Ilara-Mokin, Ondo State, with over 30 higher institutions participating . The event would be staged at the Smokin Hills Golf Resort, Ilara Mokin from March 13 to 15, 2020. According to Bayo Aderinto, the Manager at the host course, the event is one of the unique ways the management of the course is contributing to the development of the game of golf. “Most of golf development programmes are focused on kids and club members, which clearly shuts out teenagers and young adults especially those in tertiary institutions. This is what we are out to encourage and develop”, he said. He added that the event compliments the Nigeria Golf Federation’s development agenda and also have rippling effect on the future of the game in the country. Aderinto said credit should be given to Toyota, Work and Play, Wema Bank, JAC Motors and others. Also, to the Founder of Elizade Group of companies, Chief Michael Ade. Ojo for the vision and sponsorship of the event from inception. The event is jointly organised by Elizade University, Smokin Hills Golf Resort and Wole Adamolekun Foundation for all Nigerian Universities. Guardians and parents of participating players would also have the chance of striding at the Smokin Hills Course as they would be participating as special guests during the 54 holes encounter. Best player will be the overall gross player at the event, while net and other ancillary prizes would be awarded at the event too
