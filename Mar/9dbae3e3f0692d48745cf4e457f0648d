When the Director-General of the World Health Organisation (WHO), Mr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Thursday declared coronavirus, otherwise known as Covid-19, a pandemic, acknowledging that the virus might likely spread to all countries on the globe, and that the situation could get worse with time, there was just one message in that declaration: it is that leaders of the world must buckle up their chin straps and get on site for serious work. There’s no doubting the fact that so far, Nigeria has put up a good showing as far as containing the spread and setting up campaigns in that respect is concerned. But that, with the develop ment so far, isn’t enough. Not only must governments up their game, they should start comparing notes and seeking help on the management of the virus.
It is against this backdrop that President Muhammadu Buhari’s latest intervention in the crisis by setting up a presidential task force for the control of Coronavirus is commendable. Even more noteworthy is the choice of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha as the chairman of the task force. From the initiative to the leadership of the panel and membership made up of prominent Nigerians, many of them sitting ministers, it goes without saying the Nigerian government is leaving nothing to chance. It is also common knowledge that Boss Mustapha has carried himself well since joining the Buhari administration, in addition to being known and described as the “stabilizer” by other stakeholders in the government. His interventions in matters of all kinds have remained mature, tactful, measured and without sentiments or biases, plus showing capacity at all times. Definitely, the president thought good making him head the task force!
