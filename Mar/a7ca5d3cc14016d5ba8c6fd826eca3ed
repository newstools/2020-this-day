Rangers forward, Israel Abia missed a big chance to go in front in the battle for the Eunisell Boot over the weekend, when he fluffed a spot-kick in his teams 0-0 draw at MFM FC in a Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) match on Sunday. Abia currently tied on 10 goals with Akwa United’s Ndifreke Effiong would have moved one goal clear if he had converted a 50th-minute penalty at the Agege Stadium. He fired his attempt from 12 yards over the bar, which leaves the race for the Eunisell Boot wide open. However, there is a new entrant in the race for the coveted award that is given the league’s leading marksman by the sponsors of the award. Kano Pillars striker, Auwalu Ali, has moved up in the chart, after scoring twice to secure a 2-2 draw at Lobi Stars for his club in a thrilling contest at the Aper Aku Stadium in Makurdi. Auwalu now joins Victor Mbaoma of Enyimba on nine goals as the race for this season’s prestigious award is gradually inching closer to the finish line with 15 match weeks remaining. The race for the Eunisell Boot continues with 10 matches on Matchday 24 on March 15.
