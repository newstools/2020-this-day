Spokesman of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Mr. Laolu Akande, has listed four unique atributes of his boss. “Those are : the grace of God that ordains and separates him and which causes him to be elevated and triumphant; the fear of God, relentless hardworking ethos and a tremendous understanding of strategy and timing,” Akande said on the occasion of his principal’s 63rd birthday Sunday. Akande who said he relocated from the US to serve the Buhari/Osinbajo administration in pursuit of its reform agenda, noted that so far he had also become a student of the rare constellation of qualities he had discovered about the Vice President. Detailing each of the four attributes, Akande said the grace of God was the “very foundation of Prof Yemi Osinbajo. It defines who he is, assures him of God’s readiness, willingness and ability to fight his battles and secures his destiny.” According to him, second is Osinbajo’s fear of God, which moderates his attitude and produces the humility many know him for. Third is his preparation, evinced by past and current hardworking ethos, he added. Akande said Osinbajo’s knowledge, strategy and timing were proofs that indeed he knows what to do and how to get it done, often times. “I have gladly been a student this past 5 years working closely for this very good man. And we are all thankful to God for preserving his life and for blessing him so much for God’s own glory,” he said.
