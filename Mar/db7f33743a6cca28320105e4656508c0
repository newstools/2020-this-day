David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka President Muhammadu Buhari has said that the fight against the Integrated Payroll Personnel Information System (IPPIS) by members of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) is a needless one. Speaking at the 14th convocation ceremony of the Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, Anambra State on Thursday, the president, who was represented by the Executive Secretary of the National Universities Commission (NUC), Prof. Abubakar Rasheed, said: “I will not end this address without touching on IPPIS, which has been in contention and a needless one at that. “I assure you all that IPPIS is not intended to trample upon university autonomy nor is it designed to subsume the university into the civil service. “The primary intention of IPPIS is to enhance greater efficiency, transparency and better management of universities’ finances.” Buhari said transparency, which IPPIS sought to achieve, should be an important moral pillar of all universities, where students are graduated based on character and learning. According to him, all universities must be committed to these cherished values if they are to serve as moral compasses to the society. The president renewed the commitment of his government to working with patriotic elements to significantly improve Nigeria’s fortune and negotiate a brighter future for all Nigerians, especially the youths.
