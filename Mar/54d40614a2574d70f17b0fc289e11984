In commemoration of the 2020 World Kidney Day, Polaris Bank has partnered Renal Dialysis Centre to organise a symposium on kidney health. The symposium which held in Lagos, was organised by Renal Dialysis Centre and sponsored by Polaris Bank with the support of Federal Ministry of Health and Lagos State government. The event also had in attendance strong delegation of stakeholders from the nation’s health sector. In his goodwill message, the Managing Director/CEO of Polaris Bank, Mr. Tokunbo Abiru, disclosed that, “Our partnership with Renal Dialysis Centre was to raise awareness, encourage prevention, detection and equitable access to care of kidney disease following the surge in cases of kidney failures and the challenges associated with seeking care and management of the disease that is proving fatal to most victims across all demographics”. He explained that: “Our commitment as a bank to the fight against Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) like kidney, is part of our contribution to society, especially to keep Nigerians safe and abreast of every information about kidney diseases, its management and care.” Speaking at the event, the Chief Executive Officer, Renal Dialysis Centre, Dr. John Okoh, disclosed the need for help, decrying that, “As part of the challenges facing kidney health in Nigeria, the cost of dialysis and kidney transplant is rather too high for middle income earners and everyday Nigerians who can barely afford it.” On his part, the Director General, Nigerian Institute of Medical Research, Prof. Babatunde Salako, advocated for more collaborations from government and private sector.
He emphasised the need to provide facilities across the country. He explained, “Once you are able to reduce the distance and provide quality service with more facilities, you are invariably improving the quality of life of patients leading to a gradual decline in the cost of dialysis in Nigeria.”
