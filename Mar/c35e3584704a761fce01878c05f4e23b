Tobi Soniyi The Special Adviser to Imo State Governor on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Humanitarian Services, Mrs Christina Ude has pledged her readiness to embark on projects that will impact positively on the lives of Imo people. Ude stated this during her assumption of office and after embarking on a routine inspection of the SDG’s corporate office along Port-Harcourt Road Owerri.
She promised to revatilise the SDG office, which had become moribund, saying she was very much prepared to revitalise the SDG office in line with the Imo state governor’s ideology. He explained that the complex has fallen far below standard with no seats, barely working air conditioners, no electric fans, no workable standby electricity, power generating set and also has only two unserviceable official vehicles. Ude, a gender activist, also said that the above challenges would only force her to brace up to ensure that the government of Senator Hope Uzodinma succeeds through strategic planning, implementation and execution of such sustainable projects that would improve the welfare of the Imo people.
She used the opportunity to call on her workers to be proactive in the discharge of their duties in line with the governor’s reconstruction, rehabilitation and recovery. She said: “I am not pleased at all with what I met on ground, but nevertheless, we are good to go, what Imo people should expect from me is a quality administration as the SA to the governor on SDGs and Humanitarian Services. “We are going to focus more on the areas of non communicable diseases reduction by ensuring an improved health care delivery system is in place, environmental cleanliness and poverty eradication, reposition both human and non human infrastructural development. “We will also partner with the media for advocacy, source for funding through harmonious working relations with donor agencies both at the local, national and international levels.”
