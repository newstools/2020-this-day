Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja The Deputy National Publicity Secretary, of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr. Yekeni Nabena, has alleged that the Deputy National Secretary of the party, Chief Victor Giadom, officially resigned his position in the National Working Committee (NWC) to contest as running mate to the party’s 2019 governorship candidate in Rivers State, Tonye Cole. Giadom, who is now the Acting
National Secretary of the party had last week called for emergency National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting scheduled for Tuesday. Nabena made the disclosure on Saturday while speaking with jorunalists in Abuja, while reacting to the legality of of the NEC meeting convened by Giadom. Nabena said: “I call on members of our party and the public to disregard the so called zonal caucus meeting which held on Thursday at the Edo State Governor’s Lodge in Abuja. The meeting was neither convened nor attended by the APC National Vice Chairman (South South), Hilliard Eta and Leader of the party in the South-South, Deputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege. Hence, all decisions reached at the purported meeting is a nullity and definitely does not reflect the views and stand of the Party’s South South caucus.” Nabena noted that the members of the party cannot be taken for a ride because of the political and 2023 presidential aspirations of Giadom’s sponsor and godfather who is attempting to control the party’s structure. According to him, “It should be known that Victor Giadom tendered his resignation letter to the National Working Committee (NWC) to contest the 2019 election as the Party’s Deputy Governorship candidate in Rivers State. It is strange and an aberration that he still attends meetings of the NWC, occupies the office of Deputy National Secretary and convenes a NEC meeting. In our politicking, we must not lose sight of due process and the dictates of the Party’s constitution.”
