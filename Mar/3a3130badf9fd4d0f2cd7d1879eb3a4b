For Tplay who hasn’t released any music publicly after December 2019, this year is about to be an explosion. In December, the talented singer rounded off for the year after the release of “Hold Ya” – a bracing gut punch of high-tension afro-beat.
Born Ezeme Hyginus Ikechukwu, the singer started formal music at an early age in his native town, Enugu. He made a debut in 2016 after his education at Obollo high school and in 2013,he joined Timbaze music. The singer and songwriter notched a couple additional hits prior to his debut single, Sere(2016), Siki (2017), Naija to overseas (2017), When money dey ft Olamide (2018), Karashika (2019), Hola Ya (2019). His goals this year is to increase his fanbase as he plans to reach more people and also drop more hit songs. He mentions Mike Adenuga, Otedola and a few others as his mentors.
