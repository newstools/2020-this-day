By Olawale Ajimotokan The 43 ministers in the federal cabinet have donated 50 per cent of their salaries for the month of March 2020 to support government’s efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic in the country.
In a statement issued in Abuja on Saturday, the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, quoted the Minister of
State for Transportation, Senator Gbemisola Saraki, who coordinated the donation, as saying it was a gesture of solidarity and support for
the federal Government’s efforts to tackle the disease, which at the last count has infected 81 persons in the country. ”This global virus outbreak will require nations, continents and smaller communities to pull together to contribute their resources and
support one another. This will facilitate an early resolution of the problem,” Mohammed further quoted Senator Saraki as saying. The ministers also commended President Muhammadu Buhari for his leadership role in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria.
