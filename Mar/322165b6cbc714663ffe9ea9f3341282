By Martins Ifijeh The Lagos State Government will be conducting clinical trial on the effectiveness of chloroquine in the prevention or management of COVID-19 infection, the Commissioner for Health, Lagos State, Prof. Akin Abayomi has said. Abayomi who disclosed this Friday while giving updates on COVID19, said the clinical trial was initiated against the fast spreading news that chloroquine could be effective in preventing and managing COVID19. The Commissioner however said that the use of the drug has not yet not been ascertained as an effective treatment of the virus, adding that the state was still watching the global research space to clearly define the efficiency of the drug in the control of the diseases. He said, “We do not have any hard evidence that chloroquine is effective in preventing or managing COVID19. We are watching the global research space to clearly define its efficiency in COVID19. “Chloroquine has significant side effects and should not be used without medical supervision as it may cause more harm than good. “Citizens should take the advice of their physicians and await the directive of the Ministry of Health on the use of chloroquine and not use it without medical supervision.” The commissioner urged the public not to panic but strictly abide by the instructions of the government. Abayomi appealed to citizens not to take advantage of the present situation on COVID19 to hike or hoard domestic consumables and enrich themselves. He however urged members of the public to continue to be their brother’s keeper and join hands with government to curtail the spread of the virus. “It is condemnable to use this situation to enrich yourselves by hoarding or hiking the prices of domestic consumables for profiteering. We should be responsible citizens in the quest to make Lagos disease free”, he said.
