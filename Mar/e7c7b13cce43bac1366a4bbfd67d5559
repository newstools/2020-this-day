The Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, yesterday called on Governors of the 36 States to support the police in the implementation of its community policing project. Speaking at a meeting with Commissioners of Police in Abuja, Adamu said the community policing strategy required the support of the governors to work effectively. He said the meeting would undertake detailed assessment of the implementation of the strategy as approved by government. The IG said recent incidents of armed banditry, kidnapping and armed robbery most especially in Kaduna, Niger, Kogi, Katsina and Zamfara States prompted the need for the full and speedy roll-out of the community policing strategy across the country. Accordingly, as conceptualised, formulated, and approved by the government, the current effort would be citizen-centered and driven by members of each community. “I also wish to appeal to all citizens and particularly, the state governors to continue to support and partner with us as we implement the community policing strategy across the country. It is only when we present a common front that we can, as a people, defeat our common enemy who are the bandits, kidnappers, and armed robbers that are testing our will and attempting to alter our values for peace and security”, he said. Adamu said the plan would involve the setting up of Community Policing Committees (CPCs) at the ward, local government, and state levels including the Federal Capital Territory. He said the committees, when inaugurated, would identify credible and suitable citizens from across each locality for appointment as special constables who will serve as Community Policing Officers (CPOs).
