The Voice Coach UK and founder of The Ultimate Gospel Singers Boot Camp, Uncle Ade, has highlighted the importance of his latest music project. According to the US-based coach, “The Boot Camp is a one week intensive training programme designed to improve the singing technique and singing IQ of artistes at a very affordable rate. “Essentially, the GSBC is an intensive programme designed to give singers detailed insight into the essential technical and practical elements that must be present, to help a singer achieve excellence in their craft. Unlike the kind of information that students typically learn at university and college, my teaching approach, and therefore content, have been developed to ensure that my students experience career defining training,’’ he stated. The event which is slated for March 30 to April 3, 2020 at Surulere, Lagos, is targeted at beginners, intermediates and advanced gospel music artistes. The programme is structured in a manner that will give all levels greater insight, understanding and a solid foundation on which to develop their voice. Those who attend will take away a wealth of knowledge and insight into the business practices, and thought-processes of some of the most successful practitioners in the African music industry. He added, ‘’I do have to point out though that it would be next to impossible to stage these camps, without the generosity of RCCG and TTC, in accommodating us. We are extremely blessed, and extremely grateful. RCCG are also sponsoring some of their choir members for the camp. I am hoping we can get more churches to do the same.”
