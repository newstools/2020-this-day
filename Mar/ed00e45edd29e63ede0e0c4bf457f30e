By Kayode Fasua The Ogun State Police Command yesterday stormed a Christ Apostolic Church (CAC) in Sagamu, dispersed worshippers and closed down the church, insisting that the church contravened government’s order that no gathering must exceed 50 persons, to deter people from contracting the deadly Coronavirus disease. The state’s Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Abimbola Oyeyemi, a deputy superintendent of police, confirmed this in a chat with THISDAY yesterday. He, however, denied raging speculation that the pastor of the church was arrested, saying, “we only got there and dispersed the gathering, since it was more than 50 as against what both the federal and the Ogun State governments directed. “We also closed down the church for flouting the order”. Oyeyemi said the police patrol team is on the look-out for all gatherings, be it social or religious, that do not comply with the order, and warned that henceforth, the police would not only disperse such gatherings but also arrest and prosecute offenders. “We are all out for the full enforcement of the order. It won’t be limited to churches and mosques alone; it will also affect social functions like burial ceremonies, weddings and all the rest, where people are more than 50. “Even, beer parlours and parties are not exempted; our people are all out for the full enforcement of the order,” he added.
