Olawale Ajimotokan in Abuja FCT Administration has issued an immediate directive to road traffic enforcement officers across the city to arrest drivers who overload their vehicles with passengers. The order was issued on Sunday morning by the Chairman, FCT Ministerial Task Team on Traffic Management, Mr Ikharo Attah. Attah said it would be grossly inappropriate for drivers to fully pack their vehicles with passengers for pecuniary gains at a time the world is advocating social distancing as a means of fighting covid-19. “Those carrying two passengers in front of their vehicles would have their vehicles impounded and drivers licence seized. Besides the health risks, it is also unsafe as the driver finds it difficult to adjust his gear and hand break,” he warned. He also added that High Capacity Bus drivers would also be properly checked to ensure that they do not overload their buses. He called on all transport operators, particularly those only permitted to operate at the suburbs, such as commercial motorcycles and tricycles to also avoid overloading. The order is also directed at managers of motor parks and transport unions to obey the directives of the FCT authority limiting any gathering to a maximum 50 persons. Attah also advised transporters to be observant of their passengers and report those with signs of respiratory challenges to appropriate health authorities for prompt examination.
