Ndubuisi Francis in Abuja MInistry of Niger Delta Affairs has warned the public against the activities of fraudsters purporting that it was registering companies to secure contracts in respect of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) office. The ministry, in a statement by Patricia Deworitshe, warned the public that neither the Minister of State, Senator Omotayo Alasoadura nor the ministry itself was awarding any contract on behalf of SDGs or any other contractor whatsoever. The statement reads: “The attention of the Hon. Minister of State, Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs (MNDA), Sen. Donald Omotayo Alasoadura, has been drawn to the activities of some unscrupulous individuals on Facebook who claim that the Office of the Honourable Minister of State is purportedly registering companies to secure contracts in respect of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) office. “This is to inform and warn the general public that neither the Honourable Minister nor the Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs is awarding any contract on SDGs behalf or any other contract whatsoever.” The statement added that information at the disposal of the ministry showed that the faceless individuals charged about N55,000 for purported contract registration fee and about N350,000 for the collection of letters of award of contract. “For the avoidance of doubt, contracts in the Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs are procured through due process only and the Hon. Minister of State for Niger Delta Affairs have nothing to do with the SDGs office which is under the direct control of the Presidency,” the statement added.
