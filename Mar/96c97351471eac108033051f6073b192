By Olawale Ajimotokan In spite of the directive by the FCT Administration against overloading of vehicles to stem the spread of Coronavirus in the nation’s capital, at least 72 drivers have reportedly contravened that order. Chairman of the Ministerial Task Team on Decongestion of Traffic, Attah Ikharo, told newsmen in Abuja that 72 vehicles were impounded across the territory by the enforcement team comprising men of the Federal Road Safety Corps, the Directorate of Road Transport Services and the Police Force. “I was at Nyanya this morning where we observed the level of compliance. I observed at Dutsen-Alhaji, Area one by Rain Oil and from what I gathered from different government agencies, about 72 cars were impounded as at 12noon today,” Attah said. He said drivers were only allowed to carry only three passengers at the back, as against their practise to load four passengers in the vehicles. He said the administration was also discussing with drivers of high capacity buses to reduce, if possible, totally eliminate standing on high capacity buses, adding the enforcement team will also discourage overcrowding at the entry points where a conductor will have some people hanging with him. “Though we have not been able to make any arrest on that one yet, we are hoping that by Monday we will commence intensive enforcement on high capacity buses, to discourage those who are standing and those who hand around the doors. “But we are appealing to commercial motorists particularly those of high capacity buses to please live their windows open for proper ventilation
and ensure passengers by the windows live them open because often times passengers by the window side want to take air that is sufficient for them without considering other passengers inside the buses.”
