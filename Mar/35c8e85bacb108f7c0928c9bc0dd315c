The federal government has constituted a 10-man committee to oversee the posting of directors from the Office of Accountant-General of the Federation to revenue-generating agencies. The Accountant-General of the Federation, Mr. Ahmed Idris confirmed the development during the closing session of a management retreat for treasury directors of finance and accounts and directors of internal audit. The retreat has as its the theme, “Global best practices in 21st-century treasury management.” The Accountant-General in a statement issued yesterday commended the minister for approving the posting of Treasury Directors to Revenue Agencies and said that the committee would handle all issues relating to the postings. Ahmed said his office would continue to take informed decisions and actions that would make the Treasury more efficient. He said his office would continue to align its responsibilities with the expectations of Nigerians and will make changes where the need arises. Idris said the sustenance of the successes of the ongoing public finance management reforms of the Federal government, depends on the efforts and integrity of Directors of Finance and Accounts and Directors of Internal Audit. He said since the responsibility of implementing the financial reforms in the Ministries, Departments and Agencies rests on the Treasury Directors, it is expedient for them to be committed and hard-working.
