Francis Sardauna in Katsina The Katsina State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Saturday conducted congresses to elect new executives of the party into the 361 wards in the 34 local government areas of the state. THISDAY, which monitored the exercise in some wards, observed that it was devoid of the usual acrimony and allegation of exclusion and was done in a peaceful atmosphere. Speaking while observing the exercise at Sabuwar Rigiya Ward in Mashi Local Government, the Chairman of the PDP national delegation for the Ward Congress, Chika Nwazozu, lauded the party faithful for their response and peaceful conduct throughout the exercise. He said: “The congress is very peaceful across the wards and we observe a large turnout at the party congress which is an obvious statement of the unrivalled popularity of the PDP in the state. “I am so overwhelmed that in an era where Katsina State is being governed by APC and we have this large turnout of people for this exercise shows that PDP is on ground and this shows that our party has evolved into a very organized party.” He however refuted claims that the party has been served with an interim court order restraining it from conducting wards congress in the state. According to him, “The court order is for the state congress and is an interim order which has a lifespan of 14 days. What we have done today (Saturday) does not violate that court order. “And if you are going to serve any court order in respect of whatever has happened, you send it to the national secretariat of the party. You cannot send it to Katsina secretariat, the laws are clear.” Nwazozu called on PDP supporters in the state to remain calm and shun acts capable of disrupting the party’s forthcoming local government and state congresses.
