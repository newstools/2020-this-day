By David-Chyddy Eleke Traditional rulers from the Anambra North Senatorial Zone of Anambra State have rejected the call by the Anambra State Elders Council for the rotation governorship position of the state to Anambra South Senatorial Zone. The elders had in their first meeting for the year endorsed the zoning of the governorship position to the southern zone. But monarchs from the Anambra North zone, who met at the weekend at the palace of the Traditional Ruler of Igbariam Community, Igwe Nkeli Nzekwe, who is also the chairman of Anambra North Traditional Rulers, refused to support the zoning of the governorship post to Anambra South. Igwe Nzekwe, who briefed journalists after the meeting of the monarchs, said: “We are traditional rulers. We are the father of all. We do not tell lies. Our role is to bless anyone who emerges as governor. You cannot zone the governorship position to a particular zone. People from other zones will also be in the contest like in previous elections. “If you want to enforce zoning, then only people from the zone where the governorship is zoned should be allowed to contest. If you leave people from other zones to contest and by a stroke of luck they win, will you take the victory away from them because they are not from the favoured zone?” Nzekwe asked. He said that the monarchs would not be forced to accept a zoning system that does not exist and called on politicians to throw the contest open, adding that what was important is for the state to have a competent governor who has the capacity to develop the state. Anambra State will hold its governorship election in November 2021 to elect a replacement for the incumbent Governor Willie Obiano, who will be leaving office on 17th March 2022 after two tenures of eight years.
