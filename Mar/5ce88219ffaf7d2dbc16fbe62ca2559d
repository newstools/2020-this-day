Israel Adesanya has had a lot to say about reigning UFC light-heavyweight champion Jon Jones, who was arrested by the Albuquerque Police Department in the early hours of Thursday morning. According to a report from the APD, Jones was taken into custody for allegedly driving while intoxicated and for negligent use of a firearm. The incident is said to have taken place shortly before 1am PT, after which an APD officer approached Jones in his black Jeep. The arresting officer wrote in his report that Jones smelled of alcohol and denied any knowledge of hearing gunshots. But after the officer administered sobriety tests, they discovered a firearm, a bullet casing and a bottle of Recuerdo Mezcal in the passenger seat. Jones, 32, tested twice over the legal limit for blood alcohol content and was subsequently taken to jail. He has since been released and will be due in court on April 8 for a bond arraignment hearing. Adesanya has been embroiled in a war of words with ‘Bones’ for several months. And ‘The Last Stylebender’ couldn’t help but make fun of Jones’ latest brush with the law. Adesanya’s mocking of Jones’ came in the form in a series of tweets, which included self-made memes. One such tweet included a picture of an inspirational message Jones posted last week urging the public to do everything they can to help curb the spread of the coronavirus, in which he told people: “Let’s not screw this up.” Adesanya’s accompanying caption read: “And on the 7th day got arrested. I mean God rested!” The Nigerian-born Kiwi ended his trolling of Jones with a video of himself saying: “Don’t kick a man while he’s down.”
