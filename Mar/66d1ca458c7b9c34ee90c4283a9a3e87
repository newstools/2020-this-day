By Kayode Fasua The Public Office Holders Association of Nigeria (POHAN), has begun an annual award programme aimed at encouraging healthy competition and boosting career prospects for all categories of public office holders. Announcing the new move through a statement made available to THISDAY in Abeokuta, Ogun State, yesterday, the POHAN National Coordinator, Chief Moses Eseyin , said principally, the POHAN National Public Service Awards and Summits for which nominations had been opened since March 20, this year, “is to promote and reward innovation and excellence in public service, in support of the realisation of government’s agenda for effective service delivery”. Eseyin, who is immediate past Special Adviser on Youth Empowerment, Sports and Students’ Affairs to Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State, said the POHAN is the mouthpiece for public servants and political office holders in Nigeria, both past and present, and that it is a non-partisan organisation that strives for a more effective government for the Nigerian people. “It rewards the creative achievements and contributions of public service institutions that lead to a more effective and responsive public administration in Nigeria; and through an annual competition, the POHAN National Public Service Awards and Summits promote the role, professionalism and visibility of the public service, before the Nigerian people,” he disclosed. He added that the proposed programme was also designed to celebrate the value and virtue of the public service to the community; highlight the contributions of public service in the development process, and recognise the work of public servants, He stressed that such a reward culture would also encourage young people to pursue careers in the public sector. Eseying applauded the level-playing ground given to public servants to excel in their chosen career under the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari and also, hailed the government for acceding to the labour’s demand for improved wages; noting that much more could be done to boost the morale of the public servants, as the POHA set out to achieve. The POHAN coordinator said that the award programme could hold sometime in October, this year.
