Imo State Governor, Senator Hope Uzodimma has ordered for partial shutdown of the state’s workforce, assuring the people of the state of his government’s preparedness to tackle head on the crisis rocking the nation and the world at large. Uzodinma spoke yesterday during the flag-off of the distribution of hand sanitizers to Ministries, Agencies, Markets (MDAs), Churches, Schools and other public places. “In continuation of our programme to nip the spread of Coronavirus in the bud, Government has decided to close all Nite Clubs and late night restaurants. From Wednesday, Civil Servants above 45 years will be encouraged not to come to work because they are the most vulnerable group.” However, he said those on essential services will continue to come to work and promised that adequate measures have been put in place for their safety.
