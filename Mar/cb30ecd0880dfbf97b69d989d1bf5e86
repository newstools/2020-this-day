James Sowole in Akure Ondo State Governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, yesterday said the federal government owes the state about N7billion, being the amount spent by the state government to fix federal roads in the state. The governor disclosed this when he received the Minister of State for Transportation, Senator Gbemisola Saraki, and officials of her ministry in the Governor’s office in Alagbaka in Akure, the state capital. Saraki was in the state for verification of the number of federal government road projects fixed by the state for possible reimbursement. Akeredolu expressed optimism that by the time the federal government officials completes their verification and carries out its deductions, the state should be able to receive over N5billion from the federal government. He noted that such repayment would go a long way in assisting the state on projects execution and payment of salary arrears. The governor said: “The claim is in the area of about N7billion. I am sure that by the time they look at it, do all their verifications-if there are going to be deductions-we should be able to have over N5billion coming to the state. “This money was spent on road projects have been completed over the years, so they are verifiable. “We believe that this will go a long way in assisting us on projects and payment of salary arrears.” Akeredolu, however, sought the support of the Minister of State for Transport on the actualisation of Ondo Port. The governor averred that the project is very crucial to his administration, noting that it is a way of building the state for the future. He said the idea is to decongest Lagos State and open up the riverine area in Ondo State for economic activities. In her response, Saraki assured the state governor that her team would be fair as they carry out their verification exercise.
