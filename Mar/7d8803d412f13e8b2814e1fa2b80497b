By Goddy Egene Losses at the stock market moderated last week despite the ravaging negative impact of the COVID-19 and weak oil prices on the global economy. The market had lost over N1.8 trillion the preceding week with the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) All-Share Index (ASI) recording an unprecedented decline of 13.49 per cent. However, the decline was lower than the previous week as the NSE ASI fell by 2.35 per cent to close the week at 22,198.43, while market capitalisation shed N279 billion to close at N11.568 trillion. All other indices finished lower with the exception of NSE Banking, NSE Insurance and NSE Oil/Gas which appreciated by 0.29 per cent, 2.8 per cent and 0.22 per cent. According to market analysts, investors would continue to react to news surrounding the crude oil market as well the Coronavirus. Analysts at Afrinvest research analysts had expected this record bearish performance, “as the economic outlook of the country remains uncertain.” “Coronavirus is rattling the healthcare, financial and economic systems around the world. Although, the impact on Africa countries initially seemed to be limited to the external account and financial markets, which are considered secondary due to net foreign capital reversals. “However, with an increasing number of cases in the continent, monetary and fiscal authorities are forced to double down on their efforts to curb the spread of the virus, as the primary impact of the outbreak is set to add an extra layer of domestic challenge to the growing problem,” the analysts said. Looking at other markets in Africa, analysts at Afrinvest said Egypt’s EGX30 emerged the top laggard, shedding 17.8 per cent while Mauritius’ SEMDEX trailed, falling 16.7 per cent. Likewise, Morocco’s Casablanca MASI and Kenya’s NSE 20 indices fell 9.8 per cent and 4.7 per cent respectively, while the Ghana’s GSE declined by 0.2 per cent. “In the BRICS market, there was a bearish performance as all indices under our coverage trended southward. Brazil’s Ibovespa index led laggards, down 13.5 per cent while India BSE Sens index lost 12.3 per cent. “South Africa’s FTSE/JSE All Share index fell 9.0 per cent despite the central bank cutting rate by 100bps and injecting liquidity into local markets. Similarly, Russia’s RTS and China’s Shanghai Composite depreciated 7.2 per cent and 4.9 per cent respectively,” Afrinvest said. The analysts noted that in Asia and the Middle East, performance was largely bearish as four of five indices closed in the red. Turkey’s BIST 100 index led laggards, down 9.9 per cent, followed by UAE’s ADX General Index and Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul ASI which declined 6.0 per cent and 1.4 per cent in that order. “Similarly, Thailand’s SET Index closed the week 0.1 per cent lower. On the flip side, Qatar’s DSM 20 index emerge the lone gainer, advancing 4.2 per cent after the government announced QR75.0 billon financial package for the private sector and another QR10bn fund infusion into the QSE in view of the challenges posed by Covid-19,” they said. Similarly, performance across the developed markets was bearish. In the United States markets, the S&P 500 and NASDAQ fell 9.9 per cent and 8.8 per cent respectively despite a $1.0 trillion emergency stimulus. “Likewise, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng and Japan’s Nikkei 225 indices declined 5.1 per cent and 5.0 per cent respectively while the United K’s FTSE All-Share index dipped 4.0 per cent. Germany’s XETRA DAX and France’s CAC 40 indices depreciated 2.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent in that order despite Germany’s $600 billion stimulus,” the analysts said.
