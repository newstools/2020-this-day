The Consumer Awareness and Financial Enlightenment Initiative (CAFEi) has announced the postponement of its annual symposium earlier scheduled for March 26, in Lagos. It explained that the postponement was due to the outbreak of COVID-19 in Nigeria. According to a statement signed by the President of CAFEi, Mrs. Debola Osibogun, the decision to postpone the symposium was to ensure the safety of all expected participants at the event. It further hinted: “Before the postponement, the symposium was supposed to be chaired by the Chairman, Access Bank, Dr. Dere Awosika, while the keynote address was supposed to be delivered by the former Deputy Governor, Central Bank of Nigeria, (CBN), Prof. Kingsley Moghalu. The postponement is regretted and further announcements about the event will be made available as soon as possible.”
