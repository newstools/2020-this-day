The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN) has postponed all its activities due to the COVID-19.
The institute explained that the spread of the virus worldwide had created uncertainty and anxiety as public and government agencies attempt to contain and combat the new viral respiratory illness. ICAN stated this in a statement signed by its Registrar/Chief Executive, Prof. Ahmed Kumshe.
It listed the programmes postponed till further notice to include ICAN Professional Examinations that was scheduled to have held yesterday in all centres in Nigeria, the United Kingdom and Cameroun; its third Southern Zonal Accountants’ Conference scheduled to hold between March 30th and April 2nd, and its 14th Northern Zonal Accountants’ Conference scheduled between April 6th and 9th in Kano. Others include the Academic Conference on Accounting and Finance that was previously fixed for April 14th to 16th in Kwara; the Mandatory Continuing Professional Development Programme, and ICAN Faculty Training Programmes. “The World Health Organisation has warned that Africa’s fragile health system meant that the threat posed by the virus is considerable. This has led to various actions by the federal and state governments in Nigeria to curb the spread of this disease,” Kumshe added.
