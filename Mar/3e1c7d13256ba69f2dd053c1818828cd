Olawale Ajimotokan in Abuja The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) has issued a 24- hour ultimatum to the striking resident doctors in the FCT to resume work or they should consider themselves as having exited the FCT Administration. The ultimatum takes effect from Friday (today). The FCT Minister of State, Dr. Ramatu Tijjani Aliyu issued the warning thursday when she addressed the media on the disputes between the administration and the resident doctors. Aliyu disclosed that an emergency meeting of top management officials of the FCTA was held yesterday afternoon after which it was agreed that all necessary measures would be put in place to ensure the FCT residents do not suffer as a result of the strike action by the resident doctors. She expressed dismay with the strike embarked by the Association of Resident Doctors, FCT Chapter over irregularities in their salaries for the months of January and February. Aliyu attributed the salary delay to the migration from the old payroll system to the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS) platform. She noted the problem with salaries was not peculiar to the resident doctors alone, but cut across all cadres of staff in the FCTA. She lamented that despite all entreaties and efforts made by the FCT Minister of State and the Accountant General of the Federation for the strike to be called off, the doctors blatantly rejected the rapprochement and refused to resume work.
