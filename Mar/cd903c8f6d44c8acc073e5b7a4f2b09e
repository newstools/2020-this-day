Peter Uzoho with agency report The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) will carry out a major shakeup which will see a number of top management officers who head different divisions of the corporation moved to new ones. The shakeup, which is expected to take effect this week, is in line with the corporation’s promise to deliver on its core mandates.
Some of the arms of the NNPC that will be affected in the reshuffle include the National Petroleum Investment Management Services (NAPIMS), Petroleum Products Marketing Company (PPMC), Group Public Affairs Division (GPAD) as well as the upstream division among others. An online medium has reported that the shakeup would affect mainly Chief Operating Officers, Group General Managers and Managing Directors of its subsidiaries. According to the order of reposting, the current Chief Operating Officer (COO), Upstream, Mr. Roland Ewubare, would move to Ventures and Business Development division while the COO Downstream, Adeyemi Adetunji, would move to Upstream. Ewubare, in the new position, is to get an additional responsibility of business development besides managing the group’s ventures.
With the sharp drop in oil prices and other challenges, Ewubare would have the onerous task of laying the groundwork for the corporation to take up new business opportunities as the National Assembly prepares to pass the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) later this year. The new position would also see him traversing the downstream, midstream and upstream sectors to develop new ventures.
Prior to his promotion as COO of Upstream, Ewubare was the Group General Manager of Petroleum Investment Management Services (NAPIMS) between August 2017 and July 2019. He was also the Managing Director of Integrated Data Services Limited, an NNPC subsidiary, from August 2015 to August 2017.
