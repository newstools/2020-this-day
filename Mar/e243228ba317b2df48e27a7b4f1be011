Mary Nnah As the day goes by and novel COVID-19 spreads like wildfire, without respect for borders, race, ethnicity or colour, a Nigerian, Bakare Mubarak, the tallest model in Sub-saharan, Africa has joined in the campaign on COVID -19 by leading authorities around the world who have taken measures like issuance of restrictions, border closures and warnings against immigration, in a bid to combat this global pandemic. To this end, Mubarak, has taken to the streets of Lagos to give affirmative of the pandemic and ultimately encourage the populace to wash their hands as often as possible, just as the World Health Organisation (WHO) has prescribed. To avoid more spread of the Corona Virus and thereby reducing rate of impending victims, Mubarak also encouraged citizens around the world to take safety precaution with alacrity, by means of social distancing, wearing of face masks, covering of mouth and nose while coughing and sneezing as well as see the doctor if feeling any symptom. This campaign was masterminded and executed by Mubarak, a Commonwealth Culture and Charity ambassador, alongside, Waiz Shelukindo, a highly expressive Fashion Designer in Tanzania and Nigeria and Creative Director of Waiz Designer brand; and Isaac Juniho Okorie a very creative minded photographer, assisted by Sebastian Ireri. COVID-19 is a reality that is changing our life patterns globally, our economies and perception. In all, we are faced with the responsibility of spreading the facts and not fear, spreading strength and not stigma, as we share a common World and this pandemic reminds us of our interconnectedness. Ultimately, we are in this together and we must combat it in oneness, to redeem our World‚Äù, Mubarak noted.
