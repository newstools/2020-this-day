The Lagos State Government is seeking to discontinue 566 non-active cases which have been in courts from 2015 below, being prosecuted by the police. The decision followed the review of the recommendation of the Committee on Decongestion of Non-criminal cases at the State High Courts and Magistrate Courts. The committee had recommended that where such prosecution at the courts have become impracticable due to delay and its attendant factors or are appropriate for plea bargain or criminal diversion, it should be discontinued. According to a statement issued yesterday, the Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Moyosore Onigbanjo (SAN), having critically examined the committeeâ€™s first phase review and recommendation, has instructed the Directorate of Public Prosecutions (DPP) to immediately file a notice of discontinuance in respect of 566 non-active cases, at the registry of the State High Court and Magistrate Court. He has further directed the immediate commencement of the second phase of the exercise. The statement signed by Director, Public Affairs, Kayode Oyekanmi, recalled that the Committee on Decongestion of Non-criminal cases was inaugurated on February 21 to review the recommendation of the Fola Arthur-Worrey led Advisory Committee on Police Prosecutorial power in Magistrate Courts. The Arthur-Worrey led Committee in their communique, recommended that the state government should review the role of Lay Police prosecutors in the criminal justice system of Lagos State.
