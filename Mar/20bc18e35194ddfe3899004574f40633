A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), in Lagos State, Chief Lanre Razak has commended the Federal and Lagos States over the way they are handling the issue of the dreaded disease called coronavirus that is ravaging the whole world in recent time.
Razak, in a media chat at the weekend said the steps taken and still being taken were indications that Nigeria is blessed with responsive administrators, who have the welfare of the citizenry at heart. According to the elder statesman, the setting up of a committee peopled by highly competent professionals by President Muhammadu Buhari to handle the issue concerning the disease has given the populace confidence that they are in safe hands. The respected politician also gave kudos to the Federal Government for relevant information concerning precautions to be taken to avoid contacting it and by extension preventing its spread. The Epe, Lagos State born member of the Governor’s Advisory Council (GAC), also gave a pat on the back of the state governor, Babajide Olusola Sanwo-Olu for prompt pre-emptive measure already taken before the disease hit the country. The preparedness, according to the APC stalwart, went a long way to assist in successful handling the first victim in Nigeria, saying that the four well equipped hospitals designated for the eventuality came handy when needed. He therefore enjoined the people to reciprocate the governments’ good gestures by utilising the telephone lines of designated centres in the event any suspected victim is sighted within their vicinities, reminding that prevention is better and cheaper than cure.
