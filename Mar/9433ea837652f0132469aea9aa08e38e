Udora Orizu in Abuja The House of Representatives has postponed deliberation on the $22.79 billion external borrowing, which was requested by President Muhammadu Buhari. The Speaker, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, made this known yesterday at the plenary. Gbajabiamila said the consideration of loan requested by the President should be stepped down. No new date has been set yet. It would be recalled that a member of the House, Mr. Henry Nwawuba, presented a petition by a group of South-East elite at the plenary on Tuesday against consideration and approval of the external loan. Nwawuba said the petition would save the National Assembly from embarrassment, adding that there was a disconnect between the loan proposal and the Fiscal Responsibility Act. Responding, the Speaker told him that the request by the President to the House to consider the loan was listed in yesterday’s order paper and was to be presented by the Chairman House Committee on Aids, Loans and Debt Management, Hon. Ahmed Dayyabu Safana.
