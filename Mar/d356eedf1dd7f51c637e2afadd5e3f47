David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka Medical doctors in Anambra State, who have been on strike for about four weeks, have returned to work in order to help manage the COVID-19 pandemic should it be found in the state. This was stated at a press briefing in Onitsha by Conference of Civil Service Doctors in the state yesterday. Chairman of the group, Dr. Livinus Chukwuma, said the suspension of the strike was in line with the oath they swore to uphold the health of the citizens. He described the decision as a sacrifice worthy of taking in view of the seriousness of the virus scourge. According to him, “Considering the current trend in the world, namely the COVID-19 and its presence in Nigeria, the civil service doctors in Anambra State feel that it is a mark of dishonor to the people of the state to remain on strike while they are facing the looming danger. “The scare of the eventual outcome of the disease will be indelible in the minds of the public and the doctors too. “In line with the oath we swore to uphold the health of our citizens, the doctors have decided to suspend the strike in order to be combat-ready for the COVID-19 pandemic. “This is a sacrifice expected of us, and must be made.” Chukwuma, therefore, called on his members to return to work immediately, while enjoining the state government to take advantage of the period to fine-tune their actions towards finding a last solution to the crisis.
