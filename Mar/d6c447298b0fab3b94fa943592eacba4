Exit in Champions League
The UEFA Champions League this season has served both the good, bad and ugly as some upsets have been recorded; especially the latest ouster of defending champions Liverpool. At the Heineken House where football enthusiasts are enjoying the ‘Better Together’ campaign, fans are now banking on Manchester City to save the day for English teams as the other competing teams have been shown the exit door just as the UK has opted out of the European Union (EU). Manchester City are keen to make a bold statement in this season’s Champions League having recently been banned from the next two editions of the competition. City has one foot in the next round after the impressive 2-1 win away at Real Madrid. Interestingly, it was a completely different scenario at the Heineken House last season as it was the English teams that ran the show with three out of the four teams from the Premier League making it to the semifinal before Liverpool and Tottenham pulled through for an iconic all-English final. Unfortunately, the same heroics cannot be repeated by the English teams this time; RB Leipzig edged out Jose Mourinho’s Tottenham Hotspurs, Atletico Madrid dramatically dumped out defending champions Liverpool, and Chelsea facing a likely exit, after a disastrous first leg home tie against Bayern Munich. The eagerly anticipated round of 16 game between Manchester City and Real Madrid have been postponed for now due to Coronavirus, but fans are guaranteed another electrifying time at the Heineken House once a new date is announced.
In the past match days, premium international beer brand Heineken has created some of the best moments that are better enjoyed together with friends. Thus spicing up this season’s battle for honours in Europe’s biggest club competition.
