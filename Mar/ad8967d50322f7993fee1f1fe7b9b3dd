By Kingsley Nwezeh Stakeholders of the Ministry of Defence Agricultural Cooperative Society (MODACS), weekend expressed confidence in the management of the organisation for an impressive performance for the year ended December 31, 2019 with N1.7 billion earning. They spoke at MODAC’s 8th Annual General Meeting (AGM) in Abuja, during which the cooperative’s stakeholders unanimously approved the proposed final dividend of N1.77. This followed the recent release of the cooperative’s audited financial results for the 2019 financial year. Speaking at the event in Abuja, President of the Cooperative, Dr. Edache Adikwu, said the AGM was an opportunity for the cooperative society to engage shareholders on its 2019 financial year performance. In his statement, Edache said “MODACS is committed to consistently deliver superior returns to our highly esteemed cooperators by ensuring that a good chunk of our profit is set aside for MODACS retirees. “In fact our administration became focused and determined towards expanding MODACS membership scope with its consequent increased monthly in-flow and stronger MODACS assets/liability Base”, he said. He encouraged members who wished to go into farming to do so, as the cooperative would always assist them with necessary facilities. “We want to encourage our members to go into agricultural farming it could be fish, poultry and so many other. “We have to think outside the box. This is just a way of complimenting and also contribute to the federal government’s agricultural policy”, he said.
