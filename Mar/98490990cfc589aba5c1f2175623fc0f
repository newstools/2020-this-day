Kemi Olaitan in Ibadan Churches in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital and other towns in the state, Sunday defied the order of the state government to avoid gatherings of more than 50 persons in a bid to halt the spread of COVID-19. While the state government made the closure of worship centres and religious gatherings voluntary, it however strongly advised churches, mosques and other religious centres not to have more than 50 people gathered in the same place at once. However some churches visited by THISDAY Sunday opened for service with large gathering of members in attendance. The Stone Church, Mokola, Ibadan recorded large number of members, but with the church providing water for washing hands as well as sanitizer for members. Also, the sitting arrangement was altered from the previous ones with large space among members while they were implored not to shake hands or hug themselves. Service also held at the Cook Memorial Baptist Church, Oja Oba, Ibadan, which also witnessed large presence of members. A member of the church, Prince Segun Adeyemo, while speaking with THISDAY, said the church opened for service based on the directive of the President of the National Baptist Convention (NBC) and National President, Christians Association of Nigeria (NBC), Rev. Supo Ayokunle, that it should gather to pray against Coronavirus. He added that the church only operated skeletal service, stating that after Sunday Service, it was prayers thereafter. At the Assemblies of God Church, Mokola, Ibadan, members were made to wash their hands and sanitizer applied before they were allowed into the church.
