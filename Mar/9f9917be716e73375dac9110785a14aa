A commissioner for finance, who craved anonymity told THISDAY last night that the meeting was inconclusive because of the sharp rejection by the various states’ representactives over what was presented for distribution among the three tiers of government. Although the source could not provide details on the cause of the deadlock, THISDAY gathered that the states’ representactives felt that the amount presented for distribution for the month of February was “too small”.
