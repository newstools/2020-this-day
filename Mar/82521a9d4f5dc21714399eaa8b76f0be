Nume Ekeghe Access Bank Plc has launched TraderLite, an account that enables micro businesses, with turnover between N50,000 and N1 million to operate their businesses with their individual name or registered business name. Speaking at the launch of the new product in Lagos, yesterday, the Executive Director, Retail Banking, Access Bank, Mr. Victor Etuokwu, said the bank looks at its customers beyond being just customers, but also as partners. He explained: “The future of Nigeria’s economy is MSMEs because they can provide more than enough jobs to the unemployed if empowered. “And that is why the bank’s passion is to offer more than financial services to its customers and also work with them in growing and expanding their businesses. “Whichever category you fall into; we are here to work with you to take your business to a whole new level.” TraderLite, a variant of the Diamond Business Advantage account within the Bank’s emerging businesses portfolio, was specially designed for micro businesses with the aim of providing financial inclusion for businesses in that segment, while equipping them with the required skills to grow their businesses. The product has two variants namely DBA TraderLite Individual, which is for individuals with unregistered businesses and DBA TraderLite Business, for registered businesses.
