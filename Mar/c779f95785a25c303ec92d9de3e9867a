This was bolstered by a 7.8 per cent and 13.9 per cent growth in interest income from corporate loans and investment securities respectively, as well as a 4.0 per cent cost of funds driven by our stable retail deposits. Resulting from cost efficiency gains within the year, cost-to-income ratio moderated to 62.7 per cent (64 per cent in 2018), whilst profit for the year grew 13.3 per cent, to N89.1billion, translating to 16.2 per cent return on average equity (RoAE),” Nwaghodoh said. Analysts’ assessment
Assessing the results, analysts at Cordros Capital said the UBA’s performance is in line with expectations for FY-19, although there was a slowdown in the momentum witnessed over the first three quarters of the year. “While this was partly due to the increased credit impairment charges, it is signal of what we expect in the coming year as contracting margins weigh on profitability in the highly regulated environment,” they said. According to analysts, interest income increased by 11.5 per cent to N404.83 billion supported by the growth across all major contributors to the line, with the largest contributions coming from loans and advances to customers (51.4 per cent) and investment securities (44 per cent). Interest expense was also up, increasing by 16.3 per cent to N182.96 billion, driven by a combination of increased expenses on deposits from customers (+18 per cent to N125.05 billion) and borrowings (+17.8 per cent to N41.41 billion). Net interest income settled 7.9 per cent higher year-on-year at N221.88 billion. Non-interest income grew by 21.2 per cent to N124.83 billion, and was driven by the growth in fees and commissions income (+22.2 per cent to N80.00 billion). Also, the bank recorded growth in income from investment securities trading (+58.7 per cent N10.64 billion). Consequent on the growth in funded and non-funded income, the bank recorded an 8.0 per cent growth in operating income to N328.45 billion. “Operating expenses settled 10 per cent higher, driven primarily by increased regulatory costs – AMCON levy (+20.2 per cent to N19.99 billion) and NDIC premium (+32.4 per cent to N9.74 billion). Nonetheless, the bank’s cost-to-income ratio settled lower at 66.1 per cent relative to 64.9 per cent in the prior year, while profit-before tax improved significantly by 4.2 per cent to N111.29 billion,” they said.
