Demola Ojo The Eko Hotels and Suites has clarified its decision to scale down operations following misinterpretations which followed an earlier statement where it said it would be scaling down services. According to a statement today by its management, the hotel takes pride in prioritizing the safety of its guests, staff and community and is taking extensive precautionary measures in fighting COVID-19. This informed the decision to only keep open Eko Signature hotel, Eko Hotel, 1415 Seafood/Steakhouse, Kuramo Sports Cafe, Lagoon Breeze and Calabash Bar, in adherence to government’s instructions of having not more than 20 people gathered in the same space. “A significant number of our administrative staff have been advised to work from home. This is because we strongly concur with the precautionary measure of social distancing, in order to eliminate the spread of the COVID-19 virus,”” the statement said. It further stated other measures to include; educating staff and providing visible information to guests about COVID-19 around all four hotel buildings; providing hand gloves and face masks to every security guard, especially those who check the temperature of everyone that uses any of the entrance gates into the hotels’ premises; mounting hand sanitizer dispensers near elevators, entry way to the halls and meeting rooms, and other public spaces around the hotels’ premises. Other measures include making sure the housekeeping team is continually disinfecting all surfaces around the premises at intervals; providing hand gloves and face masks to all staff who have direct contact with guests within the hotels’ premises; encouraging staff to properly wash their hands with soap and water at 20 minute intervals and minimizing the movement of staff by housing the staff servicing its operations within the premises of the hotel.
