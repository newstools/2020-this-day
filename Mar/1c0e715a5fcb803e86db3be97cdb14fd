The fever of cultural radicalism has recently been having a field day with the Nigerian people. From aggressive advocacy for feminism, social justice and equality, some folks are fighting to keep things just the way they are. So they go the way of rumour-mongering and make accusations. Hadiza Usman who is the Managing Director of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) has taken her final stand against the rumour that she had to play milkmaid to her superiors to get into the enviable position of MD. Whilst she has been barraged in recent times for this allegation, it is jolly good to see that she will tolerate it no more. It was the year 2016 and there were messes in the Nigerian economy and society that needed sorting out. Hadiza Usman, then 40 years old, had already taken up the activist role and chanted with the compassionate few in the #BringBackOurGirls campaign. It didn’t take long for her passion and compassion to catch the eyes of President Muhammadu Buhari, and he did the only thing reasonable – he appointed her as the MD of NPA. Since that was too hard a pill to swallow for envious folks, it didn’t take long for them to point out her inexperience and complete unsuitability for the role. Soon after, the rumour mills were grinding and Ms. Usman was reported as having sexual relations with her boss, Kaduna State governor Nasir El-Rufai, to further her ambitions. Hadiza Usman has explained that El-Rufai is not only her boss but her mentor, one who has always advocated the contribution of women in polity and economy.
Because Ms. Usman has proved those allegations false with good and effective work, her naysayers have not fine-tuned the gist to reflect nepotism of some sort or another, stating that the President was biased in his appointments. In the meantime, Ms. Usman has made her stand and point and has moved on to accomplish the purposes to which she was appointed. Shikena.
