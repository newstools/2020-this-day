Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, has said he only took few childhood friends and not 300 to Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE) to celebrate his mother’s birthday. Gbajabiamila, in a statement yesterday by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Lanre Lasisi, also denied using the tax payers’ money to sponsor the trip, while describing the report by an online platform as false. He said: “The story carried by Sahara Reporters on Monday, March 2, 2020, alleging that the Speaker of the House of Representatives Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila used public funds to take 300 guests to Dubai for his mother’s birthday is categorically false. “The Speaker, his family and a few friends were in Dubai to celebrate the 90th birthday anniversary of Alhaja Lateefat Olufunke Gbajabiamila, the Speaker’s mother.
“For the records, this event was strictly for family members and a few childhood friends for which no public funds were appropriated or expended.”
The speaker noted that not a single politician or a legislator was present at the event.
