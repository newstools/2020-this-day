By Kuni Tyessi The Arewa Education Renaissance Initiative (AERI), has called for the prioritisation of the funding of all levels and forms of education in the Northern region by governments and private organisations. The AERI warned that unless such actions were taken, the much needed development in the region would not be realised. The group, in the statement signed by Mr. Lawal Kankia Ibrahim, noted that: “Leadership at all levels need to re-dedicate itself and re-discover the political will to deal with the problems related to education in the North. “There is tremendous interest at all levels of Northern communities that needs to be mobilised and harmonised to support all initiatives towards addressing the foundations of education in the North and commence the process of rebuilding education values and structures that will give the region a new lease of life and a better chance to survive as a community.” The group vowed to mobilise all intellectual, managerial and political resources in the North to create awareness on the state of education in the North and engage all political leaders and other stakeholders to contribute ideas that would improve policies, provide resources and support towards a radical improvement of education standards in the North. It further stated that: “The initiative wishes to suggest the need to adopt holistic, realistic and productive policies in dealing with ‘almajiri,’ as current initiatives in dealing with the phenomenon are unlikely to solve the problem. “There is also the need to improve the quality of consultations with relevant stakeholders, the mobilisation of resources to support and anchor decisions, cooperation and collaboration between governments at all levels and raising awareness that the problem of ‘almajiri’ requires decisive action informed by sensitive and enlightened approach. Ibrahim called for creativity and innovation to achieve the goal of improving education in the North, which required the involvement and commitment of all stakeholders.
