Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, last week stirred the hornet’s nest, when he hinted at plans by the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to take over Lagos by the next elections in 2023. Although some of the leaders of ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) like Chief Lanre Rasak, had since asked the governor to perish the thought, it is however important to stress that this is one ambition the PDP had nursed time and time again and had failed. There’s no law that says people should not dream dreams, after all, ambitions often start off by dreaming and then, living the dream with careful planning and execution. Also, it is important to state that all is not entirely well with the ruling party in the state often referred to as the centre of excellence. But taking over Lagos from a party and people, who had developed a template to winning elections, including having all the major institutions of state under control isn’t just by talking but organised action. Maybe Makinde should face his Oyo for now.
