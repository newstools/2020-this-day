Despite Lagos and Ogun governments’ ban on religious gatherings of more than 50 persons in a bid to halt community spread of COVID-19, many churches have defiled the ban. For instance, Living Faith Church (also known as Winners Chapel) Bus from Bolade Oshodi in Lagos is presently conveying members to Canaan Land. The bus which is supposed to be four persons per role is admitting five persons per role, while some are even sat on other people’s legs. A bus ideally meant for 28 persons is presently conveying 39 adults and five children to Canaanland, Ota in Ogun State. Also worthy of note is, there is no temperature check or sanitizers applied on members as the bus moved. Passengers are heard discussing the outbreak. “No one, and nothing can stop us from God’s house. We serve a living God. That is why we are called Winners Faith” “God gives us strength against any COVID-19.”
