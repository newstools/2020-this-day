By Alex Enumah The Court of Appeal has ordered a stay of the execution of the order of an Abuja Court which suspended Comrade Adams Oshiomhole as National Chairman of the All Progressive Congress (APC). Justice Abubakar Yahaya who presided over a three-man panel of the Court of Appeal, made the order on Monday while delivering ruling in an exparte application filed by Oshiomhole. Oshiomole had in an exparte application prayed the court to halt the suspension order on the grounds that their would be no status quo ante belum if the appellate court fails to intervene. His lead lawyer, Chief Wole Olanipekun SAN, had informed the Court that their was a National Executive Committee meeting of the APC slated for Tuesday March 17, wherein the applicant would be excluded going by the suspension order of the lower court. Olanipekun submitted that the order had already created a state of disorder in the party that could degenerate if the appellate court fails to intervene. In its ruling the appellate court held that status quo can only be maintained if the order of the lower court is stayed. “I hereby make a stay of execution of the ruling of Justice Danlami Senchi, pending the hearing of the notice of appeal slated for Friday March 20, 2020”. The Court in addition ordered all parties in the suit not to take any further steps that would affect the ruling of the Court. Details later…
