Martins Ifijeh The immediate past Chairman, Senate Committee on Health, Senator Lanre Tejuoso said Nigeria will overcome Coronavirus outbreak, as the country is good at managing emergencies. Speaking with THISDAY recently he said the present National Assembly was doing the necessary criticisms and commendations needed to spur the authorities into doing the right thing. He said: “So far the situation is being managed well. The ball should not be dropped again after we overcome Coronavirus like we did after the Ebola Virus Disease outbreak in 2014. “Sanitisers in all public space along with advocacy should be constantly used they shouldn’t only be used during emergencies. “Developed countries like China and Italy that have 100 per cent functional primary health centres are still having challenges setting up prevention systems. “How many primary health centers are functional in Nigeria? This is a very big question. “We must first of all have a convenient nearby clinic that a Nigerian anywhere in the country can go to complain of Incase of any symptoms.” He however commended the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), saying the centre was showing the needed leadership to overcome the public health situation.
