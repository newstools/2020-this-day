DJ Manny Norté brings together some of music’s hottest artists worldwide hailing from Atlanta, London and Nigeria on his new track ‘4AM’. The track, which is produced by Norté, implores the vocal stylings of LVRN’s 6LACK, Nigeria’s rising star, Rema and the UK’s Tion Wayne. 4AM is the first-of-a-kind collaboration for the music producer and presenter whose parents are Ghanaian and is set to take over the summer this year. A relaxed, yet up-tempo track, with a highly infectious melody — the combination of RnB with the notable Afrobeats baseline is a perfect fusion for Norté’s first major offering as an artiste, and one that places itself perfectly across the genres. Paying tribute to his heritage, the visuals for the track is set in Accra and follows the group across the vibrant planes of the city, as they are immersed in the local surroundings and culture. The visual perfectly complements the track as it details the allure, beauty and captivating essence of a woman. Shot in December 2019, director Meiji Alabi captured striking visuals in Norte’s parents’ hometown of Teshie. It was made possible by the Afro Nation Festival that took place at nearby Laboma Beach, Accra. “There’s no other time in the calendar where you’d be able to get these artists together in Ghana. I’m really appreciative of what has come to me, and I’m blessed,” Norté says of the experience. “I’m bringing them together on my parents’ home ground. I was actually emotional in Ghana.” 4AM’ is a reflection of Norté’s identity: from his childhood days to introducing West London partygoers to rap and R&B records. “It is actually me,” he says, “If you listen to the song you know I’m about this life. It’s just real with me. Whoever knows me, I like you to see that I genuinely care about what I’m doing.”
