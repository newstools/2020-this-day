Two mobile policemen were reportedly shot dead early hours of yesterday by yet-to-be identified hoodlums in Ekete, Udu council area of Delta State. An unidentified civilian was also killed in the attack that reportedly saw a gun exchange between the late policemen and the gunmen. It was gathered that the riot police officers, whose identities could not be ascertained were attached to one Club 316 by Old Ekete Junction in the area. It was gathered that the armed men carted away riffles belonging to the policemen. In early February, one Onovughe Jovi was waylaid, alongside the mother and shot dead by suspected assassins around the area. It will also be noted that insecurity in the council area has been on the rise for a long time, given series of reported cult clashes and robbery attacks perpetuated by unknown hoodlums. Efforts to get response from the Delta State Police Command proved futile as the time of filing this report. The Commissioner of Police, Mr. Hafiz Inuwa, did not respond to a call and message put across to his mobile number.
