The German airline Lufthansa has grounded 150 aircraft due to the fast-spreading Coronavirus outbreak. The airline told the Guardian UK that 125 of the grounded planes were continental and 25 were intercontinental. Lufthansa has 752 aircraft according to its website. Earlier, Britainâ€™s Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, pledged to look into reports that airlines were flying half empty planes around the world just to retain lucrative slots under international allocation rules after a drop in demand for air travel.
