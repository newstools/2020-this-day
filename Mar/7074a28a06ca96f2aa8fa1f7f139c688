By Deji Elumoye A commissioner in Zamfara State, Alhaji Abubakar Tsafe, has called on the state Governor, Alhaji Bello Matawalle, to defect from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC). Tsafe, who is Commissioner for Rural Development and Cooperatives, spoke weekend at an APC rally in Tsafe Local Government Area of the state. The Commissioner, a chieftain of the APC, stated that the governor would need to join the APC so as to consolidate on the numerous successes being recorded in the state since the last nine months. Tsafe, who is one of the APC stalwarts appointed by Matawalle into his all-inclusive government, said the governor should join the party to move the state to the next level. The commissioner who stood in for APC leader in the state, Senator Kabiru Marafa, at the crowded rally said, “We are using this medium to call on His Excellency, Dr. Bello Matawalle to dump the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and join our party, APC. We want him to join in view of the peace we are enjoying now in the state. He stressed that the state would enjoy more federal attention as soon as the state governor moves to APC. “If the Governor joins APC, more attention would be given to the state by the federal government. He should join our camp. Our leader is anxiously waiting for him.” Matawalle who is of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) became the governor of the state last May following a Supreme Court judgment that nullified the victory of the APC sequel to an internal crisis that bedeviled the party
