Laleye Dipo in Minna The Nigerian Union of Teachers (NUT) has given the Niger State government up to the end of this month (March) to pay all categories of teachers the new minimum wage and its consequential adjustment. The union alleged that when the government commenced the payment of all workers the new wage in February several “qualified teachers” were omitted from the salary payment vouchers resulting in outcry by those concerned. The NUT had as a result of the development, compiled the list of teachers who were not beneficiaries of the 18 per cent across the board increase for senior civil servants and forwarded same to the federal government for necessary action. Rising from a state executive committee Meeting held in Minna, the state capital at the weekend, the union observed that despite teachers being the least salary earners in the state, the 18 per cent consequential adjustment was not implemented for them. The meeting noted the commitment of the ministry for local government to implement the N30,000 minimum wage “as contained in the signed agreement between organised Labour and the state government” but expressed dismay “ over the delay in paying primary school teachers’ salaries”. The communique released at the end of the council meeting declared that the new wage should be paid along with the March salary in three weeks’ time. According to the communique jointly signed by the state chairman of the union, Mr. Ibrahim Garba and the Principal Assistant Secretary General, Mr. Garba Labaran warned that “if by the end of March teachers were not paid their entitlements the union will be forced to take alternative action “The SWEC deliberated exhaustively and observed that teachers have been thrown into untold hardship arising from the delay in the payment of their salaries and unanimously resolved that February 2020 salary be paid to primary school teachers with old rate and March 2020 salaries be paid with new rate together with the arrears of three months “The council further resolved that in the event that these demands are not addressed the union will be compelled to take alternative step to press home her demands.”
