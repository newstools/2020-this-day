Riding on the investment drive of Edo State Governor, Mr Godwin Obaseki, the Edo Development and Property Agency (EDPA) in conjunction with JARA will this Friday, open a new discount supermarket in Benin City, the Edo State capital. The new supermarket is a product of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) between the state government through the EDPA and JARA (EDLP Nigeria Ltd), for the setting up of a retail chain in Benin City and environs to provide a new shopping experience to Edo people. Speaking to journalists, a representative of JARA (EDLP Nigeria Ltd), Ayo Bademosi, said JARA is Nigeria’s first discount supermarket and retail chain that is created by Nigerians, specifically for the Nigerian retail market. She added that the supermarket offers the best value on all the core products that satisfy everyday needs, noting, “JARA was first launched on the 20th of December 2019 in Ikeja, Lagos State and in partnership with the Edo State Government through the EDPA, will be opening the first discount store in South-South, Nigeria, on Sakponba Road, Benin City.” Noting that the supermarket has created a conducive environment where Nigerians can buy products for everyday needs at the best prices, she said, “We are really happy to partner with the state government on this project. The opening of the mall is a credit to the Governor Obaseki-led government, as it provided a conducive and supportive environment for us to establish and commence operations in Benin City.” The Executive Chairman, EDPA, Isoken Omo, said the state government was impressed with the fast-paced work on the facility, adding that the launch of the supermarket was a testament of the state government’s determination to attract serious investors to the state.
She added, “We are quite excited with JARA Stores opening in Benin, to bring a new retail shopping experience to Edo State. As EDPA, we are happy that this is another milestone project that has been delivered to Edo people.”
