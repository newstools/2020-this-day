Sunday Ehigiator Three pastors have been arrested by the Lagos State Police for allegedly conducting church services last Sunday in deviance to the directive by the state government that more than 50 persons should not gather. The Deputy Commissioner of Police, Operations, Lagos State, Mr. Mohammed Ali confirmed the arrest of the pastors yesterday, adding that they were not detained but warned to comply with the government’s directive to prevent further spread of COVID-19. He said: “I also implore churches and other religious organisations to follow suit. “Any religious leader caught disobeying the directive of the state government would face the consequences,” he added.
