Peter Uzoho and Oluchi Chibuzor The Eko Electricity Distribution Company (EkEDC) has expressed its preparedness to decommission UNISTAR Meters as part of efforts to provide better services to its customers. This, the firm explained, would help the company replace the older versions that were installed few years back, monitor and read the meters more efficiently, as well as upgrade the technology of which they operate. The Chief Legal Officer, EKEDC, Wola Joseph, stated this on Monday, while speaking to journalists at a stakeholders’/customers’ engagement forum in Lagos, adding that customers were required to apply for new meters in order to get the latest and more efficient meters. According to her, “We have learnt that UNISTAR meters, which were commissioned earlier, can no longer provide the maximum function which consumers require. Thus, in order to boost our capacity and product service, we have made new meters available for all other regions that are currently using the old meters. “In order to help customers transition seamlessly to the latest meters, we have established a help centre whose objective would be to hand-hold and guide customers on how to go about acquiring the new meters. “We would reach out to all our esteemed customers that are on the UNISTAR meters in writing, to switch over to the new meters that are provided.”
She, however, explained that the firm saw the need to increase its tariff for the first time since 2016, because the increase in revenue generation would help equip the establishment to operate at maximum capacity thereby, supplying more efficient power to its consumers.” Meanwhile, customers at the forum urged the management of the EkEDC to ensure adequate supply of electricity to its teeming clients and to make the process seamless.
