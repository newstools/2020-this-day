FiberOne Broadband has expressed desire to upgrade all the subscribers on its SmartHome plan of 10Mbps to 20Mbps unlimited. According to a statement made available to THISDAY by the company, the development is coming as more people are deciding to work from home to restrict the spread of COVID-19. The statement added that the company has also implemented more measures to help its technical personnel stay safe in case they have to respond to a support related issue at customer’s house or the outdoor network infrastructure in an area. According to the statement: “As our country continues to manage the COVID-19 crisis, we recognize that our company plays an important role in helping our customers stay connected. As schools suspend classes, businesses close and companies ask their employees to work from home, we want to ensure that our customers have faster broadband speed to work, learn, and carry on with their lives as we all address this collective challenge. They also confirm that the support personnel, who may need to visit the customer premises have been provided with sanitization kits and trained to maintain the highest levels of hygiene.”
