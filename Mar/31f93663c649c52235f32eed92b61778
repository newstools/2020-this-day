LAPO Microfinance Bank Limited, one of Nigeria’s leading microfinance banks, has enforced a temporary suspension of its weekly and monthly clients’ and staff union meetings across the country. This disclosure was contained in a statement issued by the Bank’s Head of Communications, Oluremi Akande. Akande, said, “given the intense nature of our interactions with our clients, the suspension of Union Meetings is a deliberate step to immediately achieve social distancing and curtail the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. “Importantly, this measure will guarantee the protection of the lives of our clients, Staff and families; and by extension, the communities we serve”. He said LAPO would continue to deploy campaigns to educate members of the public about the virus, thereby, minimising the level of infection and by implication enabling the systemic defeat of COVID-19 in our country.
