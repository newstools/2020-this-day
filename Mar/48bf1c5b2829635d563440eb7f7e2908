Commenting on the results, Chief Executive Officer, Seplat, Austin Avuru said: “As we enter a challenging phase for the global economy, Seplat will benefit from being a resilient company built on the solid foundations of prudent financial management and the careful mitigation of risk. We have previously been tested by crisis. We successfully navigated the twin challenges of the 2014/2015 oil price shock, which was immediately followed by the 16-month Trans Forcados shut-in, which drastically reduced our liquids production. Thanks to our flexibility in managing cash flows we emerged a stronger and better-funded company, ready to take advantage of new opportunities.” According to him, today’s Seplat has more cash on its balance sheet and is even more robust and diversified thanks to its continuing investments in gas, with its long-term contracts and independence from oil price volatility.
