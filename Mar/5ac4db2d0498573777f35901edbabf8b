Liverpool bounced back from their recent poor form to secure a record breaking 2-1 win against Bournemouth at Anfield yesterday. Despite going behind with less than 10 minutes into the game after Callum Wilson struck for Bournemouth, Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane got on the score sheet, to end Liverpoolâ€™s run of three straight games without a win. The win means Liverpool have now won their last 22 Premier League home games, the longest such winning run in English top-flight history, breaking their own record. The Reds have now gone 25 points clear of second placed Manchester City who will be guests to Manchester United in the Manchester derby today. Bournemouth opened scoring in the 9th minute as Wilson passed the ball into the net following a neat attacking move. In the 25th minute Liverpool equalised through Salah who found the bottom corner after Mane won the ball back. And in the 33rd minute Mane made it 2-1 after he was set free by a pinpoint Virgil Van Dijk pass before coolly slotting the ball into the net.
