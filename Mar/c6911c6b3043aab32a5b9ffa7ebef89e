No fewer than 100 children have taken part in the indigenous Rice Junior Chef Competition in Kano State, recently. The competition is an initiative of Kano State Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN) in conjunction with Vascorp Nigeria Ltd, a Fast Moving Consumers Good distribution company. According to the sponsors, the initiative was conceived to inculcate the traditional culinary skills among the youths in the so-called fast food generation as well as preserve the Nigerian food culture. The competition which involved children between ages 12- 15 was a flurry of cooking fun and exhibition of Nigerian food, particularly jollof rice, where contestants prepared their favourite dishes. Jollof rice was at the centre stage at the competition and Jolly Jollof, a ready to use spice mix with chicken flavour was the star of the event. Jolly Jollof is a ready to use blend of jollof spice mix with chicken flavour and tomato that when added to rice gives an authentic taste of Jollof rice and makes a ready pot of jollof in 20 minutes. It comes in 800g derica-size 800g. Speaking, Chairman of RIFAN, Kano State, Alhaji Abubakar Aliyu , urged Nigerians to take pride in locally produced food and stop being dependent on imported rice. The RIFAN chairman also thanked the sponsors of the programme, especially Vascorp, for their commitment and support to ensure the success of the programme. Winners of the competition were rewarded based on their performances.
