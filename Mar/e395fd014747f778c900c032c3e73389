Market analysts attributed the dismal performance in the review month to investors exiting due to concerns in the global market due to the outbreak of COVID-19 and unimpressive results released by some quoted companies. Commenting on the February market performance, a stockbroker and Managing Director of Network Capital Limited, Mr. Oluropo Dada, said the decline in the oil price was raising fears of possible naira devaluation. Also speaking on the market performance, a Senior Equity Research Analyst at Cordros Capital, Mustapha Wahab, said the earning released thus far, especially by cement and palm oil firms, have not be encouraging coupled with the fact that the January rally was domestic investors-led. He explained that the liquidity surfeit in the financial system made many domestic investors to flock to the equities market in January hence the rally witnessed, noting that the story changed in February as weak earnings releases and CBN’s continued tight regulation of the banking sector is a concern for many investors. He said: “January rally was domestic investors-led that was because of the liquidity surfeit in the system. The CBN engineered a deceleration in treasury bills and bond rates by segregating the fixed income market. “Thus, given an unimpressive yield environment, domestic investors hurriedly accumulated equities as the liquidity in the system hunted for alpha.” Wahab, noted that while domestic investors swooped on equities, foreign investors were unmoved since macroeconomic landscape was not different from last year.
