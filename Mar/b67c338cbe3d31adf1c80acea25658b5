The Ministry of Youth and Sports Development has called on Nigerian youth to tap into the opportunities created by the ministry to earn a living for themselves through the DEEL initiative. According to the Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Mr. Sunday Dare, youths should key into the ministry’s partnership with IBM Digital -Nation Africa programme to provide digital skills training which will enhance their productivities and job creation. “Youths across Nigeria who are interested in earning a living for themselves can now get online and commence training on digital skills through our partnership with IBM. This is in tandem with the ministry’s Digital Youth Nigeria (DY.ng) project conceived in 2019 under the DEEL programme.” Dare affirmed that the partnership will equip young people with the knowledge and tools to develop digital solutions to stay abreast of the dynamic changes in the new technology-driven economy. “The goals of DY.ng include equipping Nigerian youth with basic and advanced technological development skills in the digital world to be deployed across various sectors.” Digital Youth Nigeria is aimed at equipping 500,000 young people with digital skills through available Youth Development Centres and specialized Enterprise Centres in all the six geo-political zones of the country.
