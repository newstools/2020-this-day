She said, Diageo will be running series of events and panel discussions linked to the ‘each for equal’ theme, examining how employees can be allies for gender equality. “I am proud to see Diageo employees around the world pledge to be ‘each for equal’. This pledge is about each and every one of us using our voice and influence to create change, challenge stereotypes, fight bias, and broaden perceptions.” The firm will also be releasing a series of video interviews with female Diageo employees from around the world working in a variety of roles.
