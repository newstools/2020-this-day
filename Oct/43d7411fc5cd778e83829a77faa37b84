The pick of matches today is the clash between Bayern Munich opening their title defence with a home clash against Atletico Madrid. That game is to air live at 8:00pm on SS Variety 1. The German side will look to African-born Canadian international Alphonso Davies to once again inspire with his pace and composure from the wing-back position.
