Deola Aina has made a lasting impression on the public perception of beauty. The Global makeup artist has been committed to embracing and uplifting the most natural and authentic version of herself, often choosing to rock a no-makeup makeup type beat or completely ditch altogether in favour of a fresh face. The seasoned makeup artist will be launching her own beauty brand called ‘Deola Aina Cosmetics and Deola Aina Skin’. The brand’s website will officially be launched on the the 23rd of October, 2020. The brand’s ethos foreshadows what to expect from their upcoming Holiday 2020 collection: “Becoming more ourselves — body, mind, and spirit. Connecting with others so we can shine even brighter.” It is quite glaring that the brand seems to allude to a wellness-focused range of products that inform a holistic sense of self-care and nourishment through the experience of mind, body, spirit and connection. In a press statement, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Elise Claire Cosmetics Elizabeth Claire seemed to echo this sentiment, saying “we are beyond thrilled to leverage our strengths to see Deola Aina vision, as it not only aligns with her mission to make the best of beauty accessible but infuses it with an even deeper dimension. A culmination of All the flavor of being a girl Cosmetics products and personal skin care journey and her passion for bringing light into the world, this new luxury and lifestyle beauty brand will enable Deola Aina to further explore conversations about inner beauty, wellness and connection. The brand aims to bring new meaning to beauty by honouring ritual in our daily life and practicing intention in every action.” There have been no clues yet as to what we can expect exactly from the exciting pending release but we’re hoping inclusive shade ranges and consciously-minded formulations are on the list.
