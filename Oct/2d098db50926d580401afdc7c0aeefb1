One of the unfortunate turnouts of the military intervention in the attempt to disperse unarmed protesters at the Lekki toll plaza was the allegation of massacre of the youths, which automatically changed the tenor of the protest and attracted the rage of even the international community. Sadly, from all indications, there seemed to be no such things as a massacre of the protesters by the military, even though there were shootings in the air to disperse them, a development many reckoned might have resulted in stray bullets hitting some of the protesters and which is condemnable. But no one has been confirmed dead as a result. Curiously, also, many of those allegedly killed “as a result of the shootings” had suddenly come out to deny being dead. In fact, some of the names flying around came out to say they were actually in their homes at the time of the incident. Those who alleged 78 dead had equally come out to deny saying any such thing. Apart from the one person pronounced dead at the Reddington Hospital in Lekki as a direct result of blunt force trauma, being a victim of an attack on Admiralty and not the toll gate, bodies of the 78 allegedly killed have yet to be found, much less spotting their pool of blood at the plaza. That piece of misinformation turned out a result of one of the poor uses of the social media, which enraged nerves and provided the leeway for criminals to take over the state. Therefore, at the Lekki Toll Plaza on 20/10/2020, there wasn’t any massacre, lest the world knows the truth.
