By Adedayo Akinwale The Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NIDCOM) has condemned in strong terms the killing of a Nigerian in Libya. Its Chairman, Hon. Abike Dabiri-Erewa, in a statement issued Thursday, noted that the said Nigerian was allegedly set ablaze by three Libyan nationals who stormed a factory. The identity of the Nigerian man set on fire with petrol has not been revealed as investigations and interrogations of the suspected attackers who are in custody are on going. Dabiri-Erewa however described the act as dastardly, bestial and unacceptable, while calling on the Libyan authorities to apply the full weight of the law on the suspected killers. Meanwhile, a statement by the Libyan Interior Ministry has condemned the act, insisting that it was a new wave of violence on migrants in the North Africa country. The United Nations has also described the killing of the Nigerian “another senseless crime against migrants in the country”.
