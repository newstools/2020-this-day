*Begs lawyers to make case files available for court archive Segun James The Chief Judge of Lagos State, Kazeem Alogba, has said that most of the exhibits and files tendered in various cases in the Lagos State High Court located at Igbosere, have been destroyed by arsonists who attacked the court when the EndSARS protest turned violent. Alogba disclosed this during South West governors and ministersâ€™ on-the-spot assessment tour of properties destroyed by hoodlums who hijacked the #EndSARS protest. He however said some files were not destroyed when the miscreants set the court on fire. The Chief Judge pleaded with the President of the Nigeria Bar Association (NBA), Mr. Olumide Akpata, who was part of the tour, to appeal to his members to make case files available to the court in order to rebuild those destroyed in the attack. The team, led by Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State, also visited the burnt Nigeria Port Authority building, Lagos State DNA and Forensic Centre, located in CMS, and Lekki Toll Gate, Admiralty Toll Circle. At the Toll Plaza, an abandoned camera was found by Minister of Works and Housing, Mr. Babatunde Fashola, who immediately handed it to security operatives on the entourage. Although it could not be confirmed if the camera was one of those removed prior to the shooting of the EndSARS protesters by soldiers.
