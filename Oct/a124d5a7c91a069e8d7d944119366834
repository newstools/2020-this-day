By Segun James Ten days after the attack on EndSARS protesters at the Lekki Toll gate, the Lagos State Judicial Panel of Inquiry for Restitution for Victims of SARS and Related Abuses and Other Matters visited the scene of the attack. The Chairman of the nine-man panel, Justice Doris Okuwobi (retd.), and others were taken around the scene of the shootings by officials of the Lekki Concession Company (LCC). Earlier, Okuwobi said the programme of the day for the panel was to visit the scene of the shootings and to have proceedings based on their findings from the visit. “We were initially to take note of what we see at the locus and today’s proceedings were to be subsequent to what we see there. “The panel will arise very shortly to visit the locus. The panel noted that it is required of the witness to have a counsel of his choice. We will not take the proceedings of the visit of the locus until then,” she said. Meanwhile, Lekki Concession Company has said the footage of the shooting of protesters at thè Lekki toll plaza on October 20 is intact. Managing Director of the company, Abayomi Omomuwasan, said this when he took the panel on a tour of the facilities. He said most of their equipment were damaged by suspected hoodlums. He said, “We are yet to carry out our private investigation into the shootings. Yes, we have the footage intact but there has been no investigation or document from us on the shootings. “We have the toll plaza one and the Lekki toll bridge which is also known as TP3. We have the last location which is around the Chevron area. We don’t collect toll there. It is our main office and that is the Toll Plaza two. This is where the shooting of that day occurred. “We have footage like I said earlier. This is to familiarise the panel to what it is now, compared to what it was before the shootings.”
