By Seriki Adinoyi in Jos The Plateau State Government has warned looters of COVID-19 palliatives to return them in the next 48 hours or face the wrath of the law. The warning by the state government was conveyed by the state Police command in a statement which described the looters as criminals, warning them to return the palliatives before Wednesday. Acting Police Public Relation Officer (PPRO), Mr Donbey Peters, in the statement said, “Sequel to the ugly occurrences that bedevilled some parts of the state particularly Jos North and Jos South LGAs, the Commissioner of Police Plateau State Command, CP Edward Egbuka, has condemned in totality the breaking and looting into government warehouses, shops and private houses of individuals by hoodlums and other criminals within Jos and Bukuru metropolis under the guise of #EndSARS protests. “He has described it as an act of criminality aimed at truncating the tireless efforts of the police and other security agencies on the Plateau. This has led to the arrest of over a hundred people…. the Government of Plateau State is giving these looters the grace to return immediately, every looted item to the nearest local government office not later than Wednesday 28/10/2020. Anyone found in possession of any looted item after this date will be arrested and brought to book.” The Police cautioned that the 24-hour curfew imposed on Jos by the government was still in place, and warned that the police will strictly enforce it.
