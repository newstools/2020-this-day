Ibrahim Oyewale in Lokoja The Kogi State Inter-Religious Council (KOSIREC) yesterday condemned attacks on worship centres and people embarking on prayer walks or exercises for peace in the state and the country at large. The condemnation came on the heel of the attack by suspected hoodlums on the peaceful prayer walk last Monday in Anyigba, Dekina Local Government Area of the state. The prayer walk was led by Bishop David Sanda of Love Oasis Church in Anyigba, Pastor Silas Edogbo, and other clerics. The Christians on prayer walk were accosted by policemen and political thugs, who demanded that they confine their prayers to the church. In a statement jointly signed by the state Chairman of Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Dr. John Ibenu, a co-chairman of KOSIREC; and the Chairman of Jama’atul Nasril Islam (JNI), also a Co-Chairman KOSIREC, Usman Bello, and read at a press conference in Lokoja, the group also supported the position of the Nigeria Inter-Religious Council (NIREC) on the unfortunate current situations in Nigeria. The Kogi State Inter-Religious group also expressed their support for the legitimate agitations of the Nigerian youths especially with #EndSARS protesters. ‘’KOSIREC supports, identifies with and stands with all the legitimate agitations of the youths of the country, especially with #EndSARS protesters. ‘’KOSIREC also identifies endemic and systemic problems of unemployment, injustice, corruption and closure of schools as aggravators of the protests across the country. ‘’We condemn the use of force and live ammunition to suppress protests in any part of the country. ‘’KOSIREC condemns any and every attack on worship centres or people embarking on prayer walks or exercises for peace in the state and nation. ‘’We condemn all forms of destruction of public or private properties by hoodlums who hijacked the #ENDSARS protest. ‘’We cannot afford to destroy infrastructures as it is a collective loss to all,” the statement read.
