The General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church (RCCG) of Nigeria, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, has condemned the shootings of #EndSARS protesters by soldiers at the Lekki toll gate on Tuesday. He warned that such actions may worsen the situation of things in the country. This was contained in a statement issued yesterday by the General Overseer. He said: “I condemn in the strongest possible terms, attacks launched by the Nigerian military on unarmed young people, who have been peacefully protesting police brutality over the last 12 days as #EndSARS protests. “The condemnable actions of the military risk driving the agitations of the young people underground, thereby making the situation unmanageable. “I call on the federal government to thoroughly investigate the tragic events at Lekki and other parts of the country, give justice to all victims even as it engages the #EndSARS protesters to reach a common agreement to end police brutality.” He, however, called on the youths to suspend their protests for peace to reign. “I am also appealing to the Youths to allow peace reign & stop any form of action that would give the Military any other form of excuse to attack. May the peace of God come upon our nation, now more than ever in Jesus name (Amen),” Adeboye added.
