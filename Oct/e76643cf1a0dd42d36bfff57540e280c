In what looks like a reprisal, hoodlums have attacked TV Continental (TVC), believed to be owned by the national leader of the All Progress Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu. The attack on the TV station in Lagos may not be unconnected with the killing of peaceful young protesters at the Lekki Tollgate in Lagos by soldiers Tuesday night. A staff of the organisation who pleaded anonimity said, “TVC has been disconnected on DSTV for a while now. Our reporters are trapped. They said Tinubu (allegedly) ordered the soldiers to kill. “The newsroom is on fire. And we still have people inside trapped. They were updating us 2 minutes ago. Morayo Afolabi Brown has just been attacked. Our colleagues are sniffing smoke already where they are hiding.” watch video: Details later…
