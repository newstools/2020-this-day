Francis Sardauna in Katsina Youths in Katsina State under the auspices of Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG) have bemoaned the pervading spate of killings and kidnapping orchestrated by bandits in the state, saying President Muhammadu Buhari has failed Nigerians on security. The youths said the wave of banditry, rape and kidnapping ravaging Batsari and Faskari Local Government Areas of the state, had unforeseen economic, social and political implications that if not tackled will engulf the entire state. They made the assertion in a communique issued to journalists on Saturday by the North-west Vice Chairman of CNG, Mr. Jamilu Aliyu, shortly after a roundtable discussion on how to end banditry, kidnapping and rape in Katsina State, held at the Katsina State Motel. Aliyu, in the communique, said government’s attempts to reassert public confidence with repeated rhetoric of being on top of the situation, seem to be worsening the uproar as killings and kidnapping for ransom has become a daily occurrence in most parts of the state. He said: “The administration of President Muhammadu Buhari has failed the nation and in particular, Katsina State in the vital area of improving citizens lives and securing property. Many of our parents and children are still in captivity and many of them are widows and orphans. “The rise in the spate of banditry and kidnapping in places such as Faskari and Batsari lately has become a major trying point for everyone but the authorities have remained detached from the reality”. The North-West vice chairman of CNG, however, called on Governor Aminu Bello Masari to investigate the alleged misappropriation of security funds meant to stem banditry in the state by some members of his kitchen cabinet. He expressed dissatisfaction that the alleged embezzlement of security funds by government officials was coming at time residents of the state were under siege by marauding bandits and kidnappers.
