By Udora Orizu in Abuja The House of Representatives South West Caucus on Friday condemned the desecration of the cultural heritage of the South west through what it described as the unnecessary and unprovoked attacks on the palaces of the Oba of Lagos, the Soun of Ogbomosho and other eminent Yoruba cultural leaders by miscreants and hoodlums. The caucus led by its Chairman Hon. Femi Fakeye (APC Osun) at a press briefing, while condoling with the families who lost their loved ones and those otherwise victimized, appealed to all Nigerians not to turn the South west into a battle ground. The lawmakers also urged the federal government to fast-track implementation of all outlined programmes for youths empowerment and those for the most vulnerable. They stated that this will eradicate youths restiveness across the country. The caucus said, ”We affirm the inalienable right of citizens to a peaceful protest. We also appeal to the youths to eschew violence and further civil unrest. We appeal to the federal government to fast-track implementation of all outlined Programs for Youth Employments, Empowerments and those for the most vulnerable citizens of the country.” The lawmakers added that they endorsed the proposal to pay compensation to all victims of SARS as announced by the Speaker of the House Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila.
