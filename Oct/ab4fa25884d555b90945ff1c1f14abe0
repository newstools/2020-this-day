By Okon Bassey The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Akwa Ibom State Council has threatened the State Governor, Mr. Udom Emmanuel, with indefinite industrial strike if their demands were not addressed within 14 days. The ultimatum was contained in a communique issued yesterday and jointly signed by the Chairperson of NLC, Comrade Sunny James and Acting Secretary of NLC, Comrade Iboro Ibara.

The equally demanded that qualified payroll officers within the service should be used to do the same job. Part of the resolution reads: “It is evident that the plight of retired primary school teachers and next-of-kin amongst others will not be put to rest if their services continue to be retained. “Immediate end to the encroachment on the land earlier allocated to the organized labour at Ikpedip lbiono/lkot Ide, Itak by the state government. “Immediate implementation of promotions and payment of accrued promotion arrears to civil servants in the state and stoppage of the obnoxious policy of ‘notional promotion’ in the state civil service.”
