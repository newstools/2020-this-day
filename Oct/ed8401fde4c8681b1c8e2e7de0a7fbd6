LALIGA Reigning champions Real Madrid continued their unbeaten start in La Liga as goals from Vinicius Junior and Karim Benzema saw off Levante. Brazil international Vinicius scored in consecutive La Liga games for the first time as he curled in a delightful finish following Luka Modric’s corner. Benzema then scored his first goal of the season in injury time with a powerful strike on the counter. After three straight league wins, Real move top of the table. As well as scoring, Benzema also struck the post in the second half, and Vinicius should have added his second of the match but, with the goal gaping, he failed to make a clean connection from Benzema’s low cross. Real captain Sergio Ramos had a headed goal disallowed for a foul as he jumped to meet Modric’s free-kick and goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois came to Real’s rescue by charging off his line to deny Gonzalo Melero before Benzema’s 95th-minute goal.
