BUNDESLIGA Robert Lewandowski scored four goals, including a dramatic 93rd-minute winner from the penalty spot, as defending champions Bayern Munich edged Hertha Berlin in a thrilling Bundesliga match. Poland international Lewandowski gave the hosts a 2-0 lead but Jhon Cordoba and Matheus Cunha responded for Hertha. The 32-year-old registered a hat-trick with five minutes remaining but Jessic Ngankam struck an 88th-minute leveller. Bayern’s prolific striker then kept his cool to convert the late winner. In their previous league game, Hansi Flick’s Bayern suffered their first defeat since December 2019 in a 4-1 loss to Hoffenheim. The Champions League winners had won the UEFA Super Cupagainst Sevilla three days prior to that defeat, which ended a run of 23 consecutive victories in all competitions and 32 games unbeaten. But on Sunday they were eventually able to build on their midweek German Super Cup triumph – a 3-2 victory over rivals Borussia Dortmund – thanks to the superb Lewandowski.
