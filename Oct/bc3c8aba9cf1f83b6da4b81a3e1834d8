Barcelona President, Josep Maria Bartomeu, will face a vote of no confidence after the threshold for required votes was met. Bartomeu has been heavily criticised in recent months and has come under increasing pressure to resign from his role. Not only did he oversee a trophyless season in 2019/20, the club also crashed out of the Champions League in humiliating fashion to Bayern Munich. Of course, Lionel Messi later handed in his request to depart Camp Nou during the summer, throwing the club into a state of chaos. And to make matters worse, he was also accused of corruption by the Catalan police force at the beginning of September. A number of fans had seen enough and launched a petition at the start of September so that Bartomeu and his board of directors would face a vote of no confidence. A total of 16,250 signatures were required for this to happen. A number of journalists and outlets have now confirmed that the required number of votes have been reached and Bartomeu and the Barcelona board of directors will now face a vote of no confidence. Alfredo Martinez of Onda Cero Radioreported yesterday that a censorship vote against Bartomeu will take place within the next month (20 working days) – that is, if the board of directors don’t resign before then. In order for Bartomeu and the board of directors to be removed, 66.6% of the votes must go against the president. Bartomeu was elected as president back in 2014, but his reign will almost certainly come to an end, at the very latest, in 2021 – with the elections set for March. But the lack of direction as well as a number of Bartomeu’s controversial decisions has led to growing discontent and now, the vote of no confidence against him.
