By James Sowole The Deputy Governor of Ondo State and the candidate of Zenith Labour Party (ZLP), Hon Agboola Ajayi, yesterday said he would defeat other candidates contesting in the next Saturday election to emerge the next governor of the state. Ajayi made the boast at Owo, headquarters of Owo Local Government Area of the state during his campaign tour, adding that he has all it takes to defeat other candidates in the election. He told the residents of the area not to panic during the election but should go out and cast their votes. Ajayi said the threat of violence before, during and after the election is an empty one as security agencies would be on ground to protect lives and property. The deputy governor regretted the violence that he said had claimed many lives during the clashes among rival political parties. He advised his supporters not to take up arms against anybody, but should go out, vote and make sure their votes count. Ajayi said: “We are here to campaign. We are not here to fight anybody. Please, don’t allow anybody to provoke you. Vote and protect your votes.” In his remark, former Governor of the state, Dr. Olusegun Mimiko, said many people were scared to attend political rallies because of the violence of the past. Mimiko, who is the national leader of ZLP, said not less than five people have lost their lives in the last few weeks as a result of political violence in the state. “They should ask the state Governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, why his party members are using guns to pursue members of rival political parties.”
