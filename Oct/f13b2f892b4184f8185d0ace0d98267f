By Chuks Okocha The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), yesterday condemned in very strong terms, the killing of peaceful protesters at the Lekki Tollgate in Lagos as well as other parts of the country. In statement issued last night by the National Publicity Secretary of the party, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, the PDP said that “it is shocking that security agents and, in some cases, thugs, were reportedly deployed to end the lives of promising Nigerians. This, to say the least, is saddening”. The PDP further said that “those responsible for the heinous murder of the innocent and harmless Nigerians must account for their nefarious acts”. The PDP called on President Muhammadu Buhari to immediately direct an end to these wanton killings across the country. The PDP also invited the International Criminal Court (ICC), to bring all those responsible for the needless deaths of these very young Nigerians to justice.
