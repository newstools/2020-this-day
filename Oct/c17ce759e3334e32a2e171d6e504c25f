Southampton manager Ralph Hasenhüttl has been left impressed by Nigerian starlet Nathan Tella and has revealed the key attributes of the former Arsenal schoolboy who is comfortable playing as a winger and playmaker. Tella is on the radar of the Nigeria Football Federation with a view to a call-up to the Super Eagles following his first team breakthrough. With the exception of the 2-0 ome win vs West Brom, the Hale End Academy product has been named in every matchday squad announced by Hasenhüttl so far this season. “What I like from him (Nathan Tella) is that he has no fear and is going in with a good attitude,”Hasenhüttl said to Southampton’s official webpage. “He is good working with the ball and against it. He has speed and bravery to go deep, to dribble and is a good combination. “In the number 10 position you must have a high workload and he does it all the time. “He can get better as his final decision making is getting better but he has some qualities that can help us in the future.” The 21-year-old Tella has made four appearances for the Saints in the Premier League since his professional debut against Norwich City.
