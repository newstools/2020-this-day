This administration places a priority on the health and wellbeing of citizens and residents and is committed to assuring that lives are not lost needlessly. “Meanwhile, all persons are reminded to still adhere under all conditions to non-pharmaceutical measures when outdoors, especially the use of face masks and hand sanitizers, as well as social distancing, in order to preserve the gains we have made in stemming community transmission of COVID-19 in Nigeria. “Federal Ministry of Health reiterates that continuation of routine service delivery is imperative, using a high index of suspicion for COVID-19, to assure staff protection from infection, considering the ease of transmission. “Chief Executive Officers of all Federal Tertiary Hospitals are to note this directive for immediate compliance please.”
