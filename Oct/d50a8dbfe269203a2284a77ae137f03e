By David-Chyddy Eleke The Assistant Inspector General of Police (AIG) in charge of Zone 13 police command, Ukpo, Anambra State, Mohammed Danmallam, has charged operatives of the Nigeria Police Force in the state to protect their armoury from hoodlums. Danmallam addressed men and officers of the Anambra State Police Command during a visit to police divisions affected by the recent protest in various parts of the country, which led to the burning of some police formations in Anambra. The AIG visited Ogidi Divisional Station, Central Police Station (CPS), Awka, B. Division, Awka, Revenue House and the Anambra State Command Headquarters, Amawbia, where he addressed officers on ground. A press release by the Zonal Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Nkiuka Nwode, said: “He commended them (officers) on the gallant discharge of their duties. He urged them to protect their armouries at all cost. He charged them not to be demoralized by the turn of events recently in the country and in Anambra State, precisely. “He commended the DPOs for their firm stand against the vandalism of their stations by the marauding assailants, while charging them to be appearing in their uniforms and ensure that they’re not overpowered by the hoodlums.” The AIG admonished officers to use the opportunity of the current situation in the country to give the force a new face in all ramifications, while reiterating the need to shun extortion, extrajudicial killings, corruption and unlawful detention of suspects on simple offences as observation of these could help restore public confidence and dignity of the police. Anambra is among states where police stations were burnt and police officers killed as a result of the EndSARS protest rocking the country.
