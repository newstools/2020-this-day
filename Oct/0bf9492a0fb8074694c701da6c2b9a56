He said: “We went for the briefing because we were invited and on our way back after the briefing, we saw some youths at the Federal Secretariat, so we stopped to interview them. “Suddenly, the police appeared from nowhere and started shooting water cannons and tear gas at us.
I ran for safety but four of them came after me. “They repeatedly hit me with their batons and a long stick. They broke my camera and also my identify card when I tried to identify myself. “As I continuously screamed that I was a journalist on duty, they shouted expletives at me as they hit me repeatedly. Some were even egging others to shoot me.” Francis said he was left in a pool of his own blood after the policemen had satisfied their quest to brutalise him.
