By Rebecca Ejifoma The Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has imposed a 24-hour curfew on all parts of the state from 4pm Tuesday October 20. The governor clarified that nobody, except essential service providers and first responders, must be found on the streets. Sanwo-Olu said, “I have watched with shock how what began as a peaceful #EndSARS protest has degenerated into a monster that is threatening the well-being of our society. “Lives and limbs have been lost as criminals and miscreants are now hiding under the umbrella of these protests to unleash mayhem on our State”. He noted that, “As a government that is alive to its responsibility and has shown a commitment to the movement #ENDSARS, we will not watch and allow anarchy in our dear state. “I, therefore, hereby impose a 24-hour curfew on all parts of the State as from 4pm today, 20th October, 2020. Nobody, except essential service providers and first responders must be found on the streets.”
