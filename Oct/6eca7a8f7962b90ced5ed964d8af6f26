Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika has said the reconstruction of a Taxiway, known technically as Taxiway B, at the at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos that was abandoned for 11 years would be completed in February next year. The minister stated this in his twitter handle after a visit to the construction site, stating “Work has commenced at Lagos taxiway B (known Central Taxiway b), abandoned for 11 years. It is a safety & efficiency matter, set to deliver it Feb ’21.” The Taxiway B would, on completion, “boost operational optimisation of the existing runway at the international wing of the airport,” said the Managing Director of the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria, Rabiu Yadudu, who accompanied the minister on the inspection. Yadudu lauded the minister’s effort, stating that the construction of Taxi B was “a critical safety item that has been missing at the Lagos airport.
“It means that the airport can handle more planes now and the runway can serve as a safety item because aircraft can be separated on the ground and have more room for maneuvering in and out.”
