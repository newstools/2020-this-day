Australia and America are friends with many characteristics in common although with a few contrasts too. In Australia, an elderly COVID patient is isolated in a hospital room and cannot have visitors even as they pass on. In America, an elderly COVID patient can leave hospital to go for a drive and wave to his fans. In Australia one in 1000 have got COVID, in America one in 50 have got COVID. In Australia one in 3000 have died from it, in America one in 1500 have died from it. We might be smaller and isolated, but we are GREAT! Come and visit us, once it is safe.
