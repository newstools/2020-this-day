The Nigerian stock market recorded another growth last week to sustain the positive trend as the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) All-Share Index (ASI) appreciated by 0.86 per cent to close at 28,659.45.
Similarly, market capitalisation added N127.6 billion to close at N14.98 trillion. As a result, the year-to date (YTD) growth stood at 6.8 per cent. The market had remained positive in the past four weeks as investors are attracted by the currently low market valuation amidst the continued low yield environment in the fixed income space.
And many analysts had remained bullish on the market. For instance, Cordros Research said they expect the market to continue to benefit as domestic investors seek alpha-yielding opportunities in the face of increasingly negative real returns in the fixed income market.
“However, we advise investors to trade in only fundamentally justified stocks as the weak macro environment remains a significant headwind for listed companies,” they said. Although the market appreciated last week, the volume and value of the previous week could not be sustained. Investors traded 1.955 billion shares worth N22.978 billion in 22,844 deals, down from 3.140 billion shares valued at N35.372 billion that exchanged hands last week in 35,099 deals the previous week.

The Conglomerates industry followed with 99.313million shares worth N87.823million in 553 deals. The third place was the Consumer Goods, with a turnover of 60.570million shares worth N991.189 million in 3,269deals. Trading in the top three equities namely United Bank for Africa Plc, Guaranty Trust Bank Plc and Zenith Bank Plc in volume terms accounted for 885.515 million shares worth N15.881 billion in 6,308deals , contributing 45.3 per cent and 69.11 per cent to the total equity turnover volume and value respectively.
