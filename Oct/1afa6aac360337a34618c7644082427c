The Lagos State Government has announced a further relaxation of the curfew imposed on the state after the breakdown of law and order, following the hijack of the peaceful #EndSARS protests by hoodlums. The curfew will now be from 10pm till 6am, the State Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr. Gbenga Omotosho said in a statement. According to him, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu praised Lagosians for observing the curfew, which is expected to restore normalcy in communities. He urged all Lagosians to go about their businesses in peace, even as they shun “actions that can threaten our unity.” “The Governor advises purveyors of fake news to stop causing disaffection among Lagosians, who are well known for being peace-loving and friendly,” the statement.
