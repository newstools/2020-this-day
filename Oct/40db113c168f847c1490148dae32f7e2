By Vanessa Obioha A hospitality real estate and wine production conglomerate, Spanish Kingdom Group, and a global initiative for youth development, Tasieobi Global Foundation, have resolved to join forces with the Police Campaign Against Cultism and Other Vices (POCACOV). POCACOV is an initiative from the office of the Nigeria Inspector General of Police (IG) Mohammed Adamu to tame the high rate of youth’s restiveness and menace in our society. During a recent courtesy visit to the National Coordinator of POCACOV, Ebere Amaraizu, at Mohammed Adamu Resource Centre in Enugu, the Chairman of the Spanish Kingdom Group, Onyeka Ogbatu, emphasized on the spate of cultism and other vices in our society and the need to demolish the social monsters by deconstructing their underlying influences on the youth. “These challenges and the dangers they pose to the wellbeing of the people require a collective response from everyone in the society to ensure its elimination, regardless of our gender, tribe, religion and status, as anyone can become a victim. The earlier we deal with this scourge, the better for us all,” he noted. The Founder of Tasieobi Global Foundation, Elvis Tasieobi, who was present at the courtesy visit, disclosed that his foundation recently embarked on a nationwide sensitization and reorientation of youths in primary and secondary schools against nefarious activities. “Parents have a lot more to do to put their wards in check, as the bulk of the responsibility lies with the parents. Most of these cases are a result of poor parenting and upbringing as parents are too busy for their wards due to the harsh economic realities,” he said. Amaraizu appreciated their efforts and passion to be part of the initiative which is very dear to the IG. He promised them that POCACOV will never disappoint in his mission in creating a safer society for our youths. “Not with guns, but with words,” he concluded.
