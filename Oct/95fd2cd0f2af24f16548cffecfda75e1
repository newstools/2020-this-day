Equities investors ignored the violence and unrest in the country last week to increase their patronage of the market as they positioned ahead of the release of third (Q3) earnings by quoted companies. Consequently, the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) All-Share Index rose 0.13 per cent to close higher at 28,697.06.
The market recorded gains in three out of the five trading days, lifting the equities capitalisation by N19.7 billion to close at N14.999 trillion, against the expectations that the tensed security situation that led to the imposition of curfew by some states, would dampen investors’ demand. Although the NSE ASI appreciated, the value and volume of trades fell 14.4 per cent and 23 per cent in that order.
In fact, Wednesday’s sell-offs led to a decline of 0.8 per cent , which was the biggest loss since October 7, 2020. But bargain hunting on Thursday (+0.4 per cent) and Friday (+0.5 per cent) completely wiped off the losses and pushed the market into the green.
Commenting on the stock market performance, analysts at said despite the heat in the socio-political landscape triggered by the degeneration of the #Endsars protests, they did not expect a material dent to investors’ appetite for stocks. “We reiterate that pent up system liquidity and the hunt for alpha-yielding opportunities in the face of increasingly negative real returns in the fixed income market remain positive for stocks. However, we advise investors to trade in only fundamentally justified stocks as the weak macro environment remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings,” analysts at Cordros Research said. Meanwhile, investors traded a total of 1.505 billion shares worth N19.668 billion in 20,552 deals, compared with 1.955 billion shares valued at N22.978 billion that exchanged hands last week in 22,844 deals.
