By Chuks Okocha The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday expressed grief over the death of the Chairman of its Zamfara State chapter, Alhaji Ibrahim Mallaha, describing the sad development as a huge loss not only to the PDP but also to Nigeria in general. The PDP described Mallaha as a patriotic Nigerian, an excellent grassroots mobiliser and outstanding democrat, who dedicated his life to the service of the country and the advancement of humanity, for which he will be remembered by generations yet unborn. In a statement issued by the National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, PDP said Mallaha was a loyal party man, who made huge sacrifices for the unity, stability, development of Zamfara State, as well as the success of the party not only in Zamfara State but also at the national level. The party said it deeply commiserated with the state Governor, Bello Matawalle, the Mallaha family, the state government and people of the state as well as the PDP fold in the state for the irreparable loss, and prayed that the Almighty Allah should grant eternal rest to the faithful departed.
