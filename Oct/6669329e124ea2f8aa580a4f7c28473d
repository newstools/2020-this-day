By James Sowole The African Democratic Congress (ADC) yesterday declared that its candidate, Mr. Dapo Adelegan, was still in the race for the Ondo State governorship seat, contrary to the rumours that the party has formed coalition with a candidate of another party in the next Saturday gubernatorial election in the state. The National Chairman of the party, Chief Ralphs Nwosu, made the declaration in Akure at a news conference that preceded the grand finale rally of its governorship candidate. Nwosu, who was represented by ADC National Organising Secretary, Alhaji Ibrahim Suleiman, said the partyâ€™s candidate for the state election is the most credible politician in the state. He said the party is committed to the transformation of Ondo State economy as well as serve the people efficiently. The party, with less than 48 hours to the election, suspended some of its state executives for anti-party activities. ADC announced that Mr. Ibrahim Rasheed is the new acting chairman of the party in the state while Timothy Akinola is the acting secretary. This is just as some members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), All Progressives Congress (APC), and Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) announced their defection to the ADC. Adelegan in his speech urged the party members not to be bothered about defections but to be focused on winning the elections. He said he has campaigned across the state, and was sure of victory in the poll.
