By Olawale Ajimotokan Fears of break out of violence heightened Saturday morning as youths under the umbrella of #EndSARS commenced protest in neighbouring Nasarawa State towns and were moving towards the FCT.
Their prime objective is to barricade the strategic Abuja- Keffi Road, which connects the FCT with all the north central, north- eastern and south eastern states.
The economic and social effects of a shutdown of the Abuja- Keffi Road can only be imagined.
The fear of escalation is also premised on the concern that the protesters might be attacked in the Nyanya- Mararaba axis by youths who are diametrically opposed to the #End SARs protest.
Different groups of youths, bearing placards and echoing chants for police reforms, left Karu, New Nyanya, One Man Village in the Nasarawa end, heading towards Abuja.
The move to barricade the Abuja Keffi-Road is coming on the heel of the total shutdown of the Abuja International Airport Road by protesters on Friday.
The blockage of the Airport Road around Abuja City Gate, disrupted movement along that axis and caused hardship for commuters, majority of whom were stranded.
