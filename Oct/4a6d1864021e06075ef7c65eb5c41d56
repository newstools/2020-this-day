It said that this will be done in keeping with management’s commitment to transparency and accountability and in consonance with the principles of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) of which it is a partner. Giving further insight into the 2019 AFS, the CFO disclosed that general administrative expenses also witnessed a 22 per cent dip from N894 billion in 2018 to N696 billion in 2019. The national oil company stated that majority of the subsidiaries posted improved performance namely, the Nigerian Petroleum Development Company Limited (NPDC) which recorded N479 billion profit in 2019 compared to N179 billion in 2018 representing a 167 per cent increase.
