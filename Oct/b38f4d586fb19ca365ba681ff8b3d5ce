No fewer than six vigilantes have been allegedly killed in a renewed bandit attack in Kagara community of Rafi Local Government Area of Niger State The bandits were said to have launched the attack around 7a.m yesterday, blocking the Pandogari road. Unconfirmed sources said some drivers and passengers were killed and injured during the attack. A source said various calls to the police for security went unanswered, leaving the vigilantes to face the bandits, leading to the death of their colleagues. It was also learnt that the vigilantes took the corpses of their colleagues to the Police Divisional Office in Kagara during a protest. Not satisfied with the response of the police to their plight, the vigilantes mobbed the police station, destroying the armoury and going away with ammunition. The source said: “The vigilantes took the corpses of their slain colleagues to Kagara police divisional office, and protested and mobbed the police station, burgled the armoury and went away with their ammunitions. “They were angry that the police did not do anything about the attack or respond to call for help as they left only the vigilantes to battle the bandits which led to the death of some of their colleagues.” The Chairman of Rafi local government area, Samaila Dan-Modibo has imposed a 24- hour curfew due following the incident. A statement by Niger Police Command said four vigilantes died during the clash with the bandits. It said contrary to the vigilantes’ report, the police arrived at the scene of the bandit attack promptly. The statement by the state Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Abiodun Wasiu, explained the command dispatched a reinforcement team led by the Deputy Commissioner of Police in charge of Operations, adding normalcy was restored upon their arrival.
