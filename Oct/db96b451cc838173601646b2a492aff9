Goddy Egene Sovereign Trust Insurance Plc has postponed its annual general meeting (AGM) earlier scheduled to have held yesterday. The underwriting firm said the postponement of the AGM became inevitable due to the curfew imposed by the Lagos State Government in response to the prevailing security situation in the state. It said a new date would be announced, while apologising for any inconveniences arising from this postponement.
