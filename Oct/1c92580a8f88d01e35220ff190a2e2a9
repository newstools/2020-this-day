One of the more unusual restrictions due to the COVID pandemic has been that a number of schools have banned Woodwind and Brass music practise and performances due to the possibility of the virus being spread further. We need to protect ourselves and others by isolating as needed and wearing a mask, always, although a mask does interfere with blowing a saxophone or similar instruments. The world is getting weirder, but I am hoping it is getting better. Time for students to return to trumpet the good news. Dennis Fitzgerald,
