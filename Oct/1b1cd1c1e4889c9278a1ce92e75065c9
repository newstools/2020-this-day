Following Tuesday’s shootings of protesters by security operatives at the Lekki toll gate in Lagos State, Stakeholders of Nigerian Youths (SONY) has called on the federal government to show leadership and good faith by fishing out those responsible for the shooting of peaceful protesters which left many people injured and a yet-to-be confirmed number of deaths The group also called on the Inspector General of Police, Mr. Mohammed Adamu to immediately investigate the activities of hoodlums and their sponsors, to ensure they are brought to book. Convener of the group, Mr. Ikechukwu Obinna, who made the call at a press conference in Abuja yesterday, lamented that the huge economic investments are up in smoke which the common masses bear all the brunt. Obinna who appealed to protesters to use dialogue approach with the government by giving them ultimatum and timelines to meet the five-point demands, said the group would consult widely with traditional institutions, religious leaders and youth leaders to ensure that the youths are never again neglected. “Let’s avoid more deaths from the hoodlums and enemies of our future, let’s avoid the destruction of properties and unnecessary loss of life and valuables, because evil people abound and will like to see us go the way of Libya and Syria. “We refuse to let our country burn and we are optimistic that the government will be sincere and genuine this time in finding a lasting solution to police brutality, corruption and other ills bedeviling our great nation. “Let’s mourn the heroes who has fallen for this just cause and leave the streets so that we will not incur more deaths, we are all pained but it is wise for us to restrategise, regroup and dialogue with the government, not because we are afraid of dying for what we believe in but because we must achieve the aim of this protest,” he said.
