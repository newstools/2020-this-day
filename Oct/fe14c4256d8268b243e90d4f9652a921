By Seriki Adinoyi Christian leaders have been charged to reflect on recent happenings in the country and look forward to the times ahead. The President of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Rev. Samson Ayokunle, made the charge in Jos Plateau State during the launching of a book titled: ‘God’s Model for the Church’ written by Pastor Oloruntunde Folorunsho, where he urged Christians to focus on how to overcome the present day challenges facing the church. Represented by the Chairman of Youth Wing of CAN, Mr. Markus Audu, Ayokunle said that it was important to emphasize that challenges are not accidental but timely and are for particular purposes, adding that God tests us in such ways to enable us realize His greatness for our lives. He said: “That which does not kill us makes us stronger. “I have dwelt on these words of encouragement because I want all Nigerians to approach this new challenge with a renewed sense of vigour and the understanding that we all must work for the kind of society that we desire to have. If we want peace and prosperity, then we must work for it and not lament over the challenges.” Also speaking, the Chairman, Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN), Pastor Dangana Stephen, pointed out that Christian leaders must learn to support their leaders in prayers and in “physical support during this crisis period, and above all things, we must all exhibit love and sacrifice for ourselves and our nation in our collective quest for a better Nigeria”. Author of the book, Folorunsho, said the book was written to address crucial issues in the church at this period of crisis in the nation. He called on Christians to draw nearer to their creator in times like this, and to commit themselves to the unity and peaceful co-existence of the country. He insisted that most of the challenges plaguing the nation can be overcome by prayers, selflessness and tolerance of one another, noting that no nation can excel without the help of God.
