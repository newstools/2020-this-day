By Seriki Adinoyi The President of Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Rev. Samson Ayokunle has charged Christian leaders to reflect on recent happenings in the country and look forward to the times ahead. Ayokunle gave the charge in Jos during the launching of a book titled “God’s Model for the Church,” which was written by Pastor Oloruntunde Folorunsho. He urged Christians to focus on how to overcome the present day challenges that are facing the church. Ayokunle, who was represented by the Chairman of Youth Wing of CAN, Mr. Markus Audu, said that it was important to emphasise that challenges are meant for particular purposes, adding that God tests us in such ways to enable us realise His greatness for our lives. He said: “That which does not kill us makes us stronger. I have dwelt on these words of encouragement because I want all Nigerians to approach this new challenge with a renewed sense of vigour and the understanding that we all must work for the kind of society that we desire to have. If we want peace and prosperity, then we must work for them and not lament over the challenges.” Also speaking, the Chairman of the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN), Pastor Dangana Stephen, pointed out that Christians must learn to support their leaders in prayerfully and physically during this crisis period and “exhibit love and sacrifice for ourselves and our nation in our collective quest for a better Nigeria.” Folorunsho said that he wrote the book to address crucial issues in the church at this period of crisis in the nation and called on Christians to draw nearer to their creator and commit themselves to the unity and peaceful co-existence of the country. He insisted that most of the challenges plaguing the nation could be defeated by prayers, selflessness and tolerance of one another, noting that no nation could excel without the help of God.
