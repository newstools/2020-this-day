By Onyebuchi Ezigbo The non-teaching staff unions in the universities, Non-Academic Staff Union of Educational and Associated Institutions (NASU) and Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities (SSANU) have said that they have devised an alternative means of payment of salaries that would take care of peculiar needs of the universities. Against the background of complaints raised by the unions regarding the inadequacies of the existing Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information Systems (IPPIS), NASU and SSANUâ€™s negotiating team has informed the Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige during their meeting on Tuesday that they have developed their own payment platform, which would address the needs of the university system. THISDAY gathered that the name of the platform is University General Peculiar Payroll Payment System, (UGPPPS). A source privy to the meeting told THISDAY that Ngige had assured the unions that federal government is favorably disposed to any research that can assist to fine tune the payment system. The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) had earlier presented to federal government its own homegrown alternative to IPPIS, known as, University Transparency and Accountability Solution (UTAS).
