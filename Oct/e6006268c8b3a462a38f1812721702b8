By Rebecca Ejifoma Super Eagle’s striker, Odion Ighalo, has decried the killings of unarmed peaceful protesters at the Lekki Tollgate on Tuesday night, describing the government as a global shame. The Manchester United striker took to his Twitter to vent his displeasure and shock over government’s decision to kill her own citizens with military personnel trained for war. He bemoaned: “I’m sad and heartbroken. Nigerian government is a shame to the world for killing your own citizens and sending military to the streets to kill unarmed protesters because they were protesting for their rights. It is uncalled for.” Ighalo noted that this present government will be remembered in history for the massacre of October 2020. The striker said: “I am ashamed of this government. We are tired of you guys and we can’t take this anymore.” Ighalo, therefore, called on world powers like the UK government, UN, and world leaders to see what is going on in Nigeria and help the poor citizens. He emphasised: “The government is killing its own citizens. I’m calling on my brothers and sisters in Nigeria to remain safe. Stay indoors. This government is a killer. They will keep killing if the world does not talk about this.”
