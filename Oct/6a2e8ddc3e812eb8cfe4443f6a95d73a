Goddy Egene The equities market recorded another slide yesterday as profit taking persisted after a 12-day rally was halted on Wednesday. The Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) All-Share Index (ASI) depreciated by 0.31 per cent to close at 28,546.22, while market capitalisation shed N46.1 billion to be at N14.9 trillion. The negative performance was driven by price depreciation in Dangote Cement Plc, Nigerian Breweries Plc and BUA Cement Plc. However, in terms of price gainers, more stocks appreciated as 26 stocks appreciated while 17 stocks depreciated. Deap Capital led the price losers with 10 per cent, trailed by Mutual Benefit Assurance Plc with 8.7 per cent. Cornerstone Insurance Plc shed 8.3 per cent, while Nigerian Breweries Plc and Conoil Plc lost 7.0 per cent and 5.5 per cent respectively.

Ecobank Transnational Incorporated added 8.5 per cent, just as AXA Mansard Insurance Plc added 7.1 per cent. C & I Leasing Plc chalked up 5.9 per cent. Shareholders of C & I Leasing Plc are to meet soon to authorise the board to convert to convert $10 million loan stock of Neoma Africa Fund, L.L.C (formerly Aureos Africa Fund L.L.C.) to 987.500 million ordinary shares of the company. The shareholders will also authorise the Board of Directors to issue and allot 987.500 million shares to Neoma Africa Fund, L.L.C.
