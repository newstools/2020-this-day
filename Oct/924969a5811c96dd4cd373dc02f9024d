The Eko Electricity Distribution Company (EKEDC) yesterday debunked news making rounds that it removed supply from the Admiralty Toll Plaza on Lekki -Epe expressway on October 20th, 2020. In a statement signed by the Company’s General Manager, Corporate Communications, Godwin Idemudia, the company explained that the Lagos State had contracted the supply of electricity to the plaza and the street lights to an Independent Power Plant, stressing that it isn’t in charge of electricity supply to the plaza. He said “We will like to respectfully and categorically state that EKEDC does not handle power supply to the Lekki toll gate and they independently generate their own power supply through IPPs. “The rest of the Lekki area supplied by EKEDC had power supply from us throughout the night save for any areas where there were technical faults” “We are extremely saddened by the turn of events and we stand with all well-meaning Nigerians who want a better future for our dear nation. “EKEDC Management vows to continue to provide best possible electricity supply, customer service and fault resolution for as long as it is safe for our staff to leave their homes/families and arrive at their work locations safely.” Idemudia thanked Lagos residents for their cooperation always and urged them to stay safe.
