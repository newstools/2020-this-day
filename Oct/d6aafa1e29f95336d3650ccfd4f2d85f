He call on all faith-based organisations, including Christian and Muslims, to support his administration as the state under his leadership will continue to carry everyone along to enhance peace, unity and the development of the state. The governor, who chaired the occasion, was represented by his Special Adviser on Youths and Sports, Hon Kwanta Yakubu, and donated N5million to enable the church furnish the edifice and other required items they may need. The governor said the government of the state recognises the contributions of the ERCC to the development of education, health, women and youth empowerment, as well as leadership development programmes for the youths through the boys brigade and girls brigade programmes. Sule concluded that the state government would continue to partner all faith-based organisations in the state as veritable tools in shaping the society for responsible citizenship and national patriotism for the promotion of peaceful co-existence in Nasarawa State.
