In a statement issued by Nigerian Red Cross Society, Secretary General, Abubakar Kende, he said Cross River state Branch Secretary, reported that the policemen and security guards on duty prevented a break in, however, the crowd returned and overpowered the policemen, gained access and vandalized all the furniture and took away nonfood items found in the building. According to Kende, ”The Nigeran Red Cross Society wishes to state that while it is true that the Nigerian Red Cross does take delivery of relief materials, we systematically distribute these items to the most vulnerable in the society on a strictly needs basis. The action of the unknown persons is condemnable as the Nigerian Red Cross was set up in 1960 to alleviate human suffering wherever it may be found. Our Staff and Volunteers do this across Nigeria, in strict compliance to our fundamental principles of humanity, impartiality and independence, among others. ”In compliance with the safer access rules, we urged our staff, members and volunteers to stay away from the office until the situation is reviewed and necessary safeguards put in place. We remain committed to the service to humanity in accordance the NRCS Act and our fundamental principles.”
