Udora Orizu in Abuja The First Lady, Aisha Buhari, has created a new hashtag on Twitter #Achechijamaa (save the people) and shared it with a song highlighting the insecurity and killings in Northern Nigeria. The music video she tweeted via her verified Twitter handle @aishambuhari, appealed to the President to address insecurity in Northern Nigeria. The music video in Hausa language showed images of Security Service Chiefs in meetings with President Buhari at the Presidential Villa. The translation goes thus: “Please in the name of God, pay attention and intervene on our plight. The North is crying! Our blood is being shed! Our people are being killed! Our properties and wealth are being destroyed; Baba, Please intervene; Baba Please protect us!” See the the first lady’s tweet #Achechijamaa pic.twitter.com/I9fOo640uo — Aisha M.
