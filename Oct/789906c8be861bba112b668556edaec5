Deji Elumoye in Abuja A member of the National Assembly, Senator Chimaroke Nnamani, has described as disheartening last Thursday’s road accident that claimed the lives of 21 pupils of a Catholic Nursery/Primary school in Enugu. Nnamani, a former governor of Enugu State and senator representing Enugu East in the upper legislative chamber of the National Assembly, commiserated with the government and people of Enugu State over the fatal accident that claimed the lives of the pupils. The Chairman of the Senate Committee on Cooperation and Integration in Africa/NEPAD, in a condolence message to the state governor, Chief Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, parents and guardians of the deceased pupils, said the incident was unfortunate and disheartening even as he wished survivors with injuries speedy recovery. He lamented over the fatal accident saying: “It was one tragedy too many,” adding that: “These young stars and future leaders cut down in their prime is sad and regrettable. My heart goes out to the governor, parents and guardians of these pupils.” Nnamani, while appealing to motorists to ensure the roadworthiness of their vehicles and abhor reckless driving especially in these ’ember’ months, urged the Enugu State government to immortalize the deceased with an educational monument to ensure that they did not die in vain.
