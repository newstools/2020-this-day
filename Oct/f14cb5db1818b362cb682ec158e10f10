Global law firm Hogan Lovells has announced that its Head of Africa Practice, Andrew Skipper, has been appointed as Co-Chair of Africa Investors Group (AIG). Skipper joins Emma Wade-Smith OBE, Her Majesty’s Trade Commissioner for Africa, as Co-Chair. The organisation hinted that the initiative, which was formed earlier this year, aims to ensure the right support for existing UK investors in Africa, as well as give guidance to other UK companies on investing in the continent. Reacting to his new appointment, Skipper expressed, “I am delighted to accept this position. I am passionate about ensuring more investment goes into Africa, and, more importantly, that these investments are targeted and informed.” There is considerable interest, he continued, in the continent among UK companies, and the AIG hopes to harness and direct this interest. Announcing Skipper’s new role, Wade-Smith commended, “Andrew has long-standing credentials in supporting business in Africa and has a strong network. “I’m looking forward to working closely with him and all AIG members to help drive this important initiative forward so that we can see real and practical progress in the coming months.”
