For the organizers of the annual Arise Walk for Life, this year’s edition lived up to its billing, in spite of the restrictions occasioned by the coronavirus pandemic.
It was, indeed, a momentous moment for the Convener of Arise Walk For Life, Dr. Siju Iluyomade, as many answered her call aimed at encouraging fitness exercises. Though this year’s edition held in clusters across many parts in the country, it attracted many dignitaries walking simultaneously in clusters to adhere to COVID-19 protocols. During the event Tagged #StayingAlive on Saturday, October 17, she was joined by her husband, Pastor Idowu Iluyomade; wife of Ogun State Governor, Mrs. Bamidele Abiodun; a former First Lady of Cross River, Mrs. Onari Duke and wife of Chairman of Daar Communication, Mrs. Moji Dokpesi, among others in front of St. Saviour School, Bourdillon Road, Ikoyi down to the Ikoyi bridge and environs. Former Super Eagles stars like Peter Rufai, Taribo West and Jonathan Akpoborire also teamed up with her to add more side attraction to the day. In other parts of the states, Lagos State First Lady, Dr. Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu, and wife of the Deputy Governor, Mrs. Oluremi Hamzat, joined the walk in another cluster, walking along Marina area of the state along with some wives of members of the state’s Cabinet. Also joining the walk was the wife of Kebbi State Governor, Dr. Zainab Bagudu, along with her aides in the state capital as well as the Minister for Women Affairs, Dame Pauline Tallen in Abuja.
The event, which preludes the yearly Arise Women Conference on October 31, also featured Arise Boat cruise to spice up the day.
