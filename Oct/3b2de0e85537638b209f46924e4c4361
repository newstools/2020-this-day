By Kingsley Nwezeh The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) Area Command in Kano State yesterday handed over one Sanusi Abdullahi Labaran, who was arrested while attempting to smuggle 5,342 Automated Teller Machine Cards (ATM) out of the country, to the Kano zonal office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) for further investigation. The NCS Area Comptroller, Kano and Jigawa State Command, Nasiru Ahmed, who handed over the suspect to the EFCC in Kano, disclosed that the suspect was apprehended at the Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport by Customs officers as he attempted to board an Ethiopian Airline to Dubai, United Arab Emirates. He further disclosed that a search conducted on the suspect yielded 5,342 ATM cards bearing different names which he concealed in a bag of beans. Also found on him were seven pieces of memory cards and one SD card. The suspect was handed over along with the items recovered from him, including his travel documents and Dubai resident permit. The zonal head of the EFCC, Aliyu Mohammed, while lauding the partnership between the two agencies, commended NCS for the arrest. He assured them that the EFCC would conduct a diligent investigation to unraveling the mystery surrounding how the suspect got the ATM cards as well as his mission to Dubai. “The commission will leave no stone unturned in tracing the owners of the ATM cards and the reason behind the efforts he made to ship these ATM cards to Dubai,” Mohammed stated.
