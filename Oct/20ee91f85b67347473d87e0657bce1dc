By Ugo Aliogo The Managing Director, Rinotech Facilities Nigeria Limited, Prince Innocent Anaele, has appealed to the conveners of End SARS protesters to suspend the protests and allow government address their concerns. He also urged President Muhammadu Buhari to set up a committee involving past presidents and Heads of States, security chiefs with representatives from the six geopolitical zones as members. He remarked that the invitation should also be extended to the conveners of the endsars protesters within one month to come up with clear terms on how the issues raised by the protesters could be solved. The Rinotech Facilities boss also advised the conveners to as a matter of urgency address Nigerians as hoodlums have hijacked the process, maiming, killing, vandalising properties that could not have been the intentions of the conveners, stating that, “By addressing your members, the situation would be under control because the atmosphere is seriously tense and we all need it to be calm. Saying with what you have done, you have proven to all that the Nigerian youths can never be taken for granted and this has served as a wake up call for those in leadership position.”
