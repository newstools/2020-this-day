Liverpoolhave received a huge boost ahead of the Merseyside derby against Evertonas two key players return. Sadio Maneand Thiago Alcantara returned to training at the Reds Melwood training complex after they both returned negative covid-19results, according to the Mirror. Both players had tested positive for the virus before the international break, and have been forced to isolate following current Government guidelines. Midfielder Thiago missed matches against Arsenal and Aston Villa before the Premier League break, with Mane missing the 7-2 drubbing by Villa, as they followed the strict rules and guidelines. Thiago had hinted at the fact he had completed his isolation period after he posted photos of himself walking around Liverpool city centre. Any player who does return a positive test result for coronavirus must undergo a ten-day isolation period and then return two negative tests in order to return to action. With both players now back in training, they could be thrown straight back into the thick of it as Jurgen Kloppâ€™s side face rivals Everton on Saturday. The Spanish midfielder is more likely to make a quick return to the starting side as Klopp will likely be without Naby Keita, who tested positive for the virus whilst on international duty with Guinea. The former RB Leipzig midfielder tested positive for covid-19 alongside other members of the Guinea squad before their friendlies against Cape Verde and Gambia in Portugal. He is waiting to for the results of his follow-up test, that if returned positive would rule him out of the Merseyside derby and almost certainly the Champions League tie with Ajax. There had been reports suggesting that the Guinea squad failed to follow protocols regarding social bubbles.
