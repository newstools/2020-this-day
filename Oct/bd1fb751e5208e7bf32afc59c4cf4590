The Managing Director of Lagos Bus Services Limited (LBSL), Mr. Idowu Oguntona, has suspended all bus operations to ensure the safety of passengers following the ENDSARS protest in the city. A statement by LBSL’s Public Affairs Officer, Mr. Afolabi Olawale, disclosed that Oguntona said the suspension was due to a viral video on social media of thugs who disrupted protesters at Alausa coming out of bus 240171. “This is contrary to the narratives being circulated across social media in respect of a bus belonging to LBSL captured at the Secretariat Bus Stop, Alausa this morning,” he said. Oguntona said that the bus was heading towards Oshodi from Berger around 8a.m when some armed individuals disembarked from a particular yellow vehicle in front of the bus at the Secretariat Bus Stop. “One of our buses during the normal cause of operations ran into approaching armed people this morning. When the people were sighted armed and heading towards our bus, commuters in the bus scampered for safety due to the imminent danger. “One of the passengers even tried to escape through the rear window of the bus. However, the armed group, whose identity remains unknown, later went their way without attacking the bus,” he said. Oguntona said that no LBSL Bus was used to commute persons to disrupt the ongoing protests. “Governor Sanwo-Olu has consistently spoken to protesters on their rights to peaceful protest, hence cannot support thugs in any form. “It is quite disheartening that this incident is linked to the activities of some hoodlums in spite of the level of understanding shown by the state government since the beginning of the #EndSarsProtest. “I plead for understanding from all esteemed passengers. I reiterate the rights of people to peaceful protests and condemn any attack on people participating in the protest,” he said.
