By Femi Solaja Devon King’s, a PZ Wilmar Brand recently launched a campaign which it tagged, “Less is More,” aimed at sensitising Nigerians on the inherent dangers in the consumption of unbranded cooking oil. This was disclosed in a statement by the Category & Brand Manager, PZ Wilmar, Toyin Popoola-Dania. Speaking on the campaign, Popoola-Dania said: “We are living in a time when now more than ever we are more conscious of our health, the Covid19 Pandemic has clearly reiterated the need for healthy eating and importance of a strong immune system. Therefore, while we are taking all the necessary precautions to avoid contacting and spreading the virus, it is equally important that we pay close attention to what we consume. “According to NAFDAC, unbranded vegetable oil is unsuitable for consumption and could have negative health implications. The agency says heart diseases are one of such problems due to high cholesterol content and other fattening agents that have been added in them.” The Executive Director, NHF, Dr. Kingsley Akinroye also said vegetable oil found to be contaminated by interference with any additive may contain high cholesterol and work against the normal flow of the body, thereby blocking heart vessels and leading to sluggishness of blood movement. According to the statement, study had shown that many people are unaware of these dangers, while many simply consider these unbranded oils more affordable. “ It was for these and many more reasons we started the “Less is More” campaign to educate Nigerians on the risks of consuming unbranded oil and possibly eliminate unhealthy oil consumption by providing them with a tested, certified, trusted and recommended alternative. Also, Nigerians need to be more aware of the fact that quantity is not always quality as this is one of the major reasons majority patronise unbranded oil.”
