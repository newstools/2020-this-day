Following the jailbreak at the Benin Prison on Monday, the Edo State Government has imposed a 24-hour curfew across the state till further notice. Hoodlums had stormed Benin Prison, also known as White House, on Monday morning and set some of the inmates free. Though, the hoodlums were engaged by the armed prison warders, some of the prisoners still escaped while several others sustained injuries. A statement by the Secretary to the State Government,Osarodion Ogie, said the curfew is to take effect from 4pm Monday The statement said the decision had become necessary because of the very disturbing incidents of vandalism and attacks on private individuals and institutions by hoodlums in the guise of #ENDSARS protesters. “While the government of Edo State respects the rights of its citizens to undertake legitimate protests, it cannot sit idly when hoodlums have taken laws into their hands to cause mayhem on innocent citizens and the state. “By the directive, schools and businesses are to shut down activities accordingly. Those who cannot move safely are to stay put between now and 4pm till calmness is restored. “Parents are advised to rein in their children, youths and wards, to forestall further breakdown of law and order. “The responsibility of government is to protect lives and property and maintain law and order, therefore, anyone found outside in violation of the curfew would be dealt with according to the law, the state added.
