Justice Sule Hassan of the Federal High Court in Lagos yesterday awarded N20 million damages against the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) for illegally and unlawfully detaining a former Director of First Bank Plc, Mr. Dauda Lawal. Justice Hassan slammed EFCC for detaining the ex-bank for 44 days without any order of court of competent jurisdiction. Lawal was arrested by the EFCC sometimes in May 2016 and he was kept in their custody for 44 days before being arraigned before Justice Hassan on charges bordering on financial crimes. While in detention, he filed a fundamental rights enforcement suit marked FHC/L/2007/2017 against the anti-graft agency. Through his lawyer, Ishaka Dikko (SAN), the ex-banker argued that his detention was illegal and unconstitutional. He argued that the action was a breach of his rights as guaranteed by various sections of the 1999 Constitution. He had consequently demanded the sum of N1billion as general damages. But the EFCC argued that Lawal’s arrest and detention were in line with some sections of the Police Act. Delivery judgment yesterday, Justice Hassan, while dismissing EFCC defence, said: “The order sought for by the applicant succeeds, he is entitled for damages. The sum of N20 million is hereby awarded in favour of the applicant and against the respondent, for unlawful detention of the applicant for 44 days,” the judge held.
