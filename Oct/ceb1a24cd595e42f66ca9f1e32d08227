By James Sowole in Akure The govenorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the October 10, 2020 Election in Ondo State, Eyitayo Jegede, has filed a petition at the Election Petition Tribunal to challenge the reelection of Govenor Rotimi Akeredolu as the governor of the State. Jegede in the petition, joined the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Deputy Govenor- elect, Lucky Aiyedatiwa, as respondents. The INEC, had declared the APC candidate, Akeredolu as the winner of the election, having scored 292,830 as against 195, 791 scored by Jegede. The results released by INEC, also showed that Akeredolu won in 15 out of 18 local governments in the state. A Port Harcourt, Rivers State based Senior Advocate of Nigeria, (SAN), Mr Ifedayo Adedipe, is the lead counsel for the governorship candidate of the PDP. Jegede in the petition, among others, alleged that
the election was marred by irregularities and pockets of violence and intimidation. The PDP candidate, also faulted the emergence of Akeredolu during party’s primaries. Jegede said with the filing of the petition, he had broken his silence on the election. “In the last 19 days I have been silent, today we break that silence in obedience to the provisions of our laws. We commence a challenge against the declaration and return made by INEC in respect of the Ondo State Governorship election of 10th October, 2020._ “By this process, let our people again begin to hope for a better future to the glory of God,” Jegede said. The Tribunal Secretary, Mr Musa Jamilu Bako, said neccessary parties, would be served.
