Heritage Bank Plc said it has joined the rest of the world to celebrate the annual Customer Service Week themed, “Dream Team.” As part of the actions to extol the patronage and loyalty virtues of their esteemed customers, Heritage Bank lined up several activities to appreciate the customers. Some of the activities to be implemented during the period include ‘Timeless Wealth Journey Challenge’ for staff which displays a typical customer’s journey with the bank at different stages of their relationship, through a video reel. Others, according to a statement from the bank include, “Fastest Finger Trivia: Be the first to answer our daily trivia correctly and win a gift; Special Customer Service Week Dress code; and Staff Face Mask Swag: Show us how you’re accessorising your look in the ‘new normal’, with your colourful face masks.” The statement which quoted a goodwill message from the MD/CEO, Ifie Sekibo, said the Customer Service Week once more provided an opportunity for the bank to exhibit the importance of teamwork and leadership in customer care in the financial industry through well-coordinated and professional customer delivery. Sekibo urged staff members to work harder in attaining uncommon results and successfully work as a team within the bank. “Working together showcases your talents to teammates. It provides a feeling of safety that allows ideas to emerge. Open communication is key when working as a team. When people work together as a team, creativity thrives. Brainstorming ideas as a group prevents stale viewpoints that often come out of working as an individual or in silos, and this enables you to achieve more,” he added.
