By James Sowole Sequel to the discovery of a crater allegedly dug on Akure Airport, Ekiti State, by persons suspected to be hoodlums, flights at the airport were grounded. The discovery of the strange crater was said to have forced the management of the airport to close the runway preventing flight from taking off or landing at the facilities. Consequently, many travellers, who wanted to travel by air through the airports, were unable to do so. A source at the airport revealed that the officials of the airport authorities discovered the crater in the night and consequently closed the runway. It said: “The hole was discovered during the early morning check by the security men of the airport. We are yet to know those behind it. I think the intention of the miscreants was to cause plane crash in the airport. The security operatives have been invited to observe the place. The government has to deploy the security agents to the airport so as not to allow the miscreants cause havoc there.” In a reaction, the spokesperson of the Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria (FAAN), Henrietta Yakubu, stated that there were cracks discovered on the runway during the routine checks yesterday morning, but said the cracks had not affected the flight operations in the airport. Henrietta, however, declared that the repair works had commenced on the cracked portions on the runway.
