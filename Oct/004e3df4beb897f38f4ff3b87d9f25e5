By James Sowole in Akure Gunmen suspected to be kidnappers Saturday abducted three persons, who were said to be travellers, in Ikakumo Akoko in Akoko North East area of Ondo State. Ikakumo Akoko is a border town between Ondo and Edo state. It was gathered that a commercial motorcycle rider who ran into the scene was beaten to stupor by the suspects, who abandoned him thinking he was dead. However, the commercial motorcyclist, who was later resuscitated, recounted the incident to the residents of the community. Reacting to the incident, the Police Area Commander for Ikare, Mr Razak Rauf, confirmed the incident. Rauf gave an assurance that police had commenced investigation into the incident. Meanwhile, residents of Akoko area of the state have expressed concern over alleged attitude of police in the area since the #EndSARS protest . The residents observed that police had abandoned their regular patrols especially on flashpoints on Akoko roads where armed robbery and abduction were rampant. The regent of Akunu Akoko Princess Tolani Orogun reaffirmed the earlier call for a military post in the area, which shares boundaries with Kogi and Edo states with a large forest being used as hideouts by the criminals. The worsening security situation has made many farmers in Akunu, Ikakumo and Auga to desert their farms for fear of being kidnapped.
