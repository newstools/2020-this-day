National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, visited Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu at the State House Marina Saturday. The visit was Tinubu’s first public appearance since the shooting of peaceful protesters by soldiers at the Lekki Tollgate on Tuesday. The shooting ignited violent attacks on public and private properties in Lagos by hoodlums, including businesses believed to be owned by Tinubu. “I didn’t go no where, I’m a Lagosian and I still hold the title of Asiwaju of Lagos, the Jagaban,” he said in response to a question on whether he travelled to London or France when the the protest escalated, as reported in on social media. He said he was at the Lagos State House “to commiserate with the government and sympathise with the victims through him, seek his permission to visit some of those victims if they are still there in the hospital.” See video.
