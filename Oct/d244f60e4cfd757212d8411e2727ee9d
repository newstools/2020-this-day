By John Shiklam in Kaduna The Kaduna State Government has imposed a 24-hour curfew in seven communities within the Kaduna metropolis. Samuel Aruwan, Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, disclosed this in a statement on Saturday in Kaduna. Aruwan did not give any reason for the curfew, however, a warehouse in the Barnawa area of the city where COVID-19 palliatives were stored, was looted by hundreds of youths who carted away foodstuffs after breaking the store. It took the intervention of the police to disperse the youth who accused the government of not distributing the palliatives. According to the statement, the communities affected by the curfew, include, Barnawa, Kakuri and Television in Kaduna South Local Government Area. Others are Maraban Rido, Sabon Tasha, Narayi and Ungwan Romi in Chikun Local Government Area.
Aruwan said “Security agencies have been directed to arrest and prosecute any found violating the curfew and those responsible for breakdown of law and order.” “Security agencies have further been directed to effect the arrest and prosecution of anyone found looting and destroying properties” the statement added. “KDSG strongly condemns the concerted incitement being done on social media.
“The government appeals to all our communities to reject incitement and resist the attempt to create chaos and anarchy.”
