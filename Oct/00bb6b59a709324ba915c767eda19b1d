By Onyebuchi Ezigbo The leadership of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has commended President Muhammadu Buhari and the Inspector General of Police (IG), Mohammed Adamu, “for being sensitive and responsive to the call for the disbandment of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS).” In a statement issued yesterday by the CAN President, Dr. Samson Olasupo Ayokunle, the Christian body said: “We are aware of the circumstances that led to the agitation which included but not limited to alleged extra-judicial killings, unlawful arrests and detentions, extortion, tortures, and disappearances of detainees.” Ayokunle said CAN acknowledged the spontaneous nature of the protest nationwide, but regretted the loss of lives and the destruction of some properties in the cause of the mass actions. “We ask God to console and comfort all bereaved persons as He heals those who are recuperating in the hospitals. “Equally, CAN appreciates the prompt and positive responses of the federal government in disbanding SARS. It is unprecedented in recent history of our country, and it is praiseworthy. This is what democracy is all about. “However, CAN is not happy with the automatic redevelopment of the officers and men of the disbanded unit to other units without sanctioning the bad eggs among them. We call for an administrative or judicial investigation into the disbanded SARS operatives with a view to bringing the culprits to book so that such bad eggs might not be allowed to corrupt other units or continue with their old habit of lawlessness. “Finally, we call on all our security agencies to be reformed and transformed into a modern security structure that befits the contemporary challenges such as terrorism, banditry, kidnapping, and herdsmen attacks. Uniformed men and women should cherish the rare opportunity the country gave them to serve and the trust of handling the security of the country by behaving responsibly. They should make us proud,” he said.
