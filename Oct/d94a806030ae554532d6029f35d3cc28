By Victor Ogunje The National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) has vowed to rid the higher institutions in Ekiti State of sexual assault, promising to work with the managements of the schools to ensure that lecturers engaging in such “animalistic” behaviour are dismissed and prosecuted. The Chairman of NANS/Joint Campus Committee, Ekiti axis, Abiola Ogunleye, stated this yesterday at a press conference held at the Ekiti State University (EKSU), Ado Ekiti, to review the activities of the body. Ogunleye, flanked by other NANS leaders, applauded the EKSU’s Vice Chancellor, Prof Eddy Olanipekun, for expelling a lecturer who recently engaged in sexual assault, saying that that would send a signal that there were no sacred cows on campuses. He also lauded the EKSU management for fast-tracking action on how to make the university fully residential by partnering private bodies to build hostels in the university. “Protection of students against all forms of victimisation, sexual assaults, and harassment is our priority. The management of all higher institutions in Ekiti State had assured us that they won’t tolerate such act. Even when a lecturer was indicted for sexual assault here in EKSU, he was dismissed from the university. This confirmed that the management has zero tolerance for harassment. “We are also happy that the university had developed a robust and interactive homegrown portal and established more lecture theatres. All these will add values and quality to education in EKSU,” he stated. Passing a vote of confidence on the leadership of EKSU, Ogunleye said they took the step to encourage EKSU management, which has worked towards full accreditation for all courses being run by the institution. The NANS leader commended the EKSU management for also donating COVID-19 facilities to the state government during the heat of the pandemic, and for prioritising the welfare of students and staff to avert internal
crisis.
