By Deji Elumoye The Senate on Wednesday postponed its debate of the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) earlier scheduled for this week by two weeks. President of the Senate, Dr Ahmad Lawan, said at plenary that the bill which was transmitted to the National Assembly by President Muhammadu Buhari last week for approval will now be considered for second reading during plenary in two weeks time. This postponement, he said, will allow copies of the bill to be circulated among the Senators by the Sergeant-at-arms and enough time for the lawmakers to peruse the document. Details later..
