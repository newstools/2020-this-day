By George Okoh A group of armed robbers yesterday attacked St. Augustine Catholic Church in Demekpe area of Makurdi, the Benue State capital. The incident, according to the Director of Social Communication, Makurdi Diocese, Rev. Fr. Moses Iorapuu, who spoke on phone to journalists, the incident took place around 2 a.m. when the robbers invaded the parish. He said the Parish Priest, Rev. Fr. Solomon Ukeyima Mfa, told him that the robbers took away several items, including, phones, ATM cards, shoes, drinks as well as huge undisclosed amount of money. “The ones (armed robbers) he saw did not cover their faces. They asked him for dollars but he told them he did not have any, and so they took away the money they could find among other items. He has reported the matter to the police. “Now, they (robbers) have infiltrated the church and attacked a priest; I do not understand their intentions. These are criminal elements, who have come into Benue State operating freely. At every instance, whatever they took, they begged for forgiveness from the priest. They were taking the items and at the same time saying ‘forgiveness us father’,” he said.
