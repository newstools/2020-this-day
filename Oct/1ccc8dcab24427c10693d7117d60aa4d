Seriki Adinoyi in Jos Following the looting and vandalism in several cities, former Minister of FCT and PDP governorship candidate in Plateau in the last general election, Lt General Jeremiah Useni, has appealed for calm, noting that “these actions can dent and diminish the genuine agitations for justice that triggered the #EndSARS protests nationwide.” Useni said, “I appeal for calm and self-restraint in the face of on-going break-ins, looting and destruction of both government and private property across the country. “Since the initial demands have already been received, noted and acknowledged by the governing authorities, it is only proper for the protesting groups to follow up on those demands within the government for speedy implementation and monitoring. “ He said that the nation must not allow itself to descend to the level of anarchy. “I appeal to the people undertaking these improper actions of outright looting and arson to stop. They should instead use alternative, peaceful and constitutional channels to resolve whatever issues they wish may be addressed toward a much better society. Destruction of national and private infrastructure does not help in improving our lives or growing our economy in anyway,” he added.
