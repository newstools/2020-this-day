When you hear the words COVID, disaster and idiot who do you think it would refer to, President Trump or Dr. Fauci? I want my medical advice from a medical expert and as Dr. Fauci is the country’s leading immunologist I would listen to him rather than someone who has already caught the virus and has been reluctant to wear masks and still holds large open events where masks and social distancing seem very distant ideas. This is a worldwide problem although America has lived up to its reputation as being a world leader, mostly for its number of cases and deaths. Listen to the world’s leaders, the medical and scientific ones not the political ones. Dennis Fitzgerald,
