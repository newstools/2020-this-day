By Kuni Tyessi The federal government has declared Thursday (tomorrow) as public holiday to mark this year’s Eidul-Mawlid celebration. The holiday is in commemoration of the birth of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him). The Minister of Interior, Mr. Rauf Aregbesola, who made the declaration on behalf of the federal government, congratulated Muslim faithful at home and abroad for witnessing this year’s occasion. He enjoined them to imbibe the spirit of love, patience and perseverance, which are the virtues of the Holy Prophet. A statement issued yesterday by the Director of Press in the Ministry, Mr. Mohammed Manga, quoted Aregbesola as saying that doing so would guarantee peace and security in the country. The minister admonished Muslims to follow the teaching of the Holy Quran in Chapter 4 Verse 59 which says: “O you who believe! Obey God and obey the Messenger, and those from among you who are vested with authority; and if you are to dispute among yourselves about anything, refer it to God and the Messenger, if indeed you believe in God and the Last Day. This is the best (for you), and fairest in the end” Aregbesola enjoined Nigerians, particularly Muslims, at this moment, to abhor violence, lawlessness, wantonness and daylight robbery as witnessed across the country. He noted Nigeria is the pride of the black race and should provide responsible leadership for the greatness and development of the African continent and all black people.
