The Enugu Electricity Distribution Plc (EEDC) said it has reversed to the old electricity tariff following an order issued by the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) for the power distribution companies to suspend the Multi Year Tariff Order (MYTO) 2020 for a period of 14 days. The suspension order is from September 28, 2020 to October 11, 2020. The Order, which was signed by NERC Chairman, James Momoh and Commissioner, Legal, Licensing & Compliance, Dafe Akpeneye, was in compliance with a joint communique issued by the federal government and the labour Unions, where it was agreed that the recently reviewed tariff be suspended by the Commission for 14 days to further consult and finalize negotiations between the parties. According to a statement issued by the Head of Corporate Communications, EEDC, Mr. Emeka Ezeh, the Disco has already complied with the directive. “With this development, prepaid customers of EEDC who experienced immediate impact of the reviewed tariff during their recharge between 28th to 30th September, 2020, the difference between the reviewed tariff and old tariff for the three days will be credited to the customers wallets, which they can use to recharge their meters in future; while for the remaining 11 days (1st to 11th October, 2020), all vending activities will be at the old tariff. “In the same vein, for postpaid customers, the difference between the reviewed tariff and the old tariff for the 14 days period will be computed and credit adjustment effected for the affected customers (that is crediting their respective accounts with the difference),” he explained. However, he noted that some category of customers were not affected by the reviewed tariff, as their tariff was frozen and they were still paying their bills using the old tariff. These, he said, are customers that fall under Bands D and E. They will continue paying/vending with the old rate, he said.
