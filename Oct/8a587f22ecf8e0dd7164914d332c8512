By Benjamin Nworie Suspected members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), yesterday launched an attack on the Central Police Station in Abakaliki, Ebonyi State capital. The station, located along the Abakaliki-Enugu Highway and close to the International market, was set ablaze by the IPOB members. They also destroyed and set ablaze cars, tricycles and motorcycles in the compound. IPOB leader, Mr. Nnamdi Kanu, had called on his members to embark on a clean-up exercise/protest around major cities in the South-east and South-south geo political zones. The exercise was peaceful in Ikwo local government area, where security agencies allowed them to move around without any confrontation. But in Abakaliki, the proscribed group members, who clearly identified themselves as members of the group, launched an attack on the police station around 3pm. They claimed that some of their members were killed by the Police during last week’s disturbances in front of the station. Many shops and businesses closed down abruptly. Governor David Umahi left a function at Old Government House and returned to the new government as reports of the incident got to him. Police Commissioner, Philip Maku confirmed the attack on the station. He said no casualty has been recorded so far. The CP also vehemently denied that any of the attackers was killed in last week’s clashes. He instead said that it was the police who later lost one of its officers who was injured during last week’s disturbances. “We are the ones being brutalised. One of the two Policemen that were wounded last week later died”, he said. IPOB spokesman, Emma Powerful, said the attackers are not members of the secessionist group.
