Chiemelie Ezeobi No fewer than four persons have been brought out dead, nine injured and scores still trapped under the rubble of a collapsed four-storey building at No 60 Odo Street, Obalende, Eti-Osa Local Government Area of Lagos State.

He however said four bodies – three males and one female – were recovered and handed over to the State Environmental Health Monitoring Unit (SEHMU) at the incident scene. Noting that rescue operation is still ongoing, he said the team had secured the incident site and was presently conducting a head count. *More details later
