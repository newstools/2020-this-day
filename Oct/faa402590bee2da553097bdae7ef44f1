Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja Following the massive looting of COVID-19 paĺiatives warehouses across the nation and the vandalisation of public and private property by hoodlums, the Inspector-General of Police, Mr Mohammed Adamu, Saturday warned trouble makers not to test the collective will of the nation by coming out to cause any further breakdown of law and order. Consequently, he ordered the immediate mobilisation of all police operational assets and resources to bring an end to the wanton violence, killings, looting and destruction of public and private property.
The IG specifically ordered all Assistant Inspectors General of Police (AIGs), Commissioners of Police (CPs), Heads of Police Operational Units, Squadron and Base Commanders in charge of Zonal/State/FCT Commands, the Police Mobile Force, Counter Terrorism Unit and the Special Protection Unit, to immediately reclaim the public space from criminal elements masquerading as protesters in some parts of the country. A statement issued by Force Headquarters said CPs and heads of police formations in the various states were charged to mobilise their men and work with the command CPs in the areas where they are domiciled in order to dominate the public space and ensure peace and safety in the affected areas.
The IG, in the statement signed by Force PRO and Deputy Commisioner of Police (DCP), Frank Mba, said “enough is enough to all acts of lawlessness, disruption of public peace and order and wanton violence which have resulted to indiscriminate looting of shops, malls and warehouses, damage to property and loss of lives in some parts of the country”. He further directed the AIGs, CPs and MPF Commanders to personally lead and coordinate the operation and use all legitimate means to halt further slide into lawlessness and brigandage.
He further called for the understanding and cooperation of the citizens assuring that the action was geared towards ensuring public order and safety and public security in our communities. The IG “warns trouble-makers not to test the collective will of the nation by coming out to cause any further breakdown of law and order”.
The IG enjoined law-abiding citizens not to panic but rather join forces with the police and other members of the law enforcement community to protect their communities from the criminal elements.
