Virgil van Dijk has undergone “successful” knee surgery to repair the anterior cruciate ligament damage he sustained in the Merseyside derby, Liverpool have confirmed. The Dutch centre-back suffered the injury in a challenge with Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford during the 2-2 draw at Goodison Park on October 17. “The Liverpool defender’s planned operation took place in London and was conducted successfully,” read a club statement. “Van Dijk will now immediately focus on the beginning of his rehabilitation with the support of the Reds’ medical department. Liverpool’s defensive worries worsened on Tuesday night when makeshift centre-back Fabinho suffered a suspected hamstring injury in their 2-0 win over Midtjylland in the Champions League. Fabinho, who had previously filled in for Van Dijk for the wins over Ajax and Sheffield United, was forced off after half an hour at Anfield. Rhys Williams, who spent last season on loan at sixth-tier Kidderminster Harriers, played the remainder of the match against Midtjylland and the 19-year-old could now make his Premier League debut against West Ham today. Brazilian goalkeeper Alisson has become the latest Liverpool player to criticise Pickford for the challenge which left Van Dijk requiring surgery. “Every goalkeeper has a different way to play and a different way to move,” Alisson told Sky Sports News. “In that moment, 100 per cent it wasn’t a necessary movement. Thinking in my mind when I go to a situation I go to finish it because if I go too soft the opponent can score. “But everyone has their own way. I don’t agree with that way, everyone can see that. It was an unnecessary moment and movement.”
