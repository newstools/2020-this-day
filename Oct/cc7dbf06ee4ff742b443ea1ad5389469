Kaiglo, a marketplace has introduced ‘Singles Day’ in the West African market.
November 11 (11/11), known as “Singles Day,” has been declared as the world’s biggest 24-hour shopping event, by the firm. In 2019, e-Commerce giant Alibaba reported sales activity totaling $38.4 billion.
The 11/11 is a singles day campaign that holds on November each year first started in China and is now the norm in most Asian countries. Speaking on the development, the Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of Kaiglo, Mr. Victor Chukwuebuka Eze, said the key feature of the event would be celebrating singlehood, “and so it features activities and products that help reinforce the beauty and joy of being single.”
According to him Kaiglo, users should expect up to 70 per cent discount on items within the 24-hour sales period. “Kaiglo’s celebration of 11/11 is the first attempt by any company in Nigeria and if done properly can make a very big statement on the brand. “The concept is new and unknown in this terrain and as such massive publicity activities must be carried out to create awareness including online and offline campaigns,” Eze said, adding that the 11/11 celebration is a relatively unknown celebration in Africa especially in Nigeria and evidence of this is the fact that none of the big brands in Nigeria has ever celebrated or acknowledged the day.
