By Chuks Okocha The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) yesterday said it would meet the 37 Resident Electoral Commissioners (RECs) of the commission today to determine the fate of the October 31 by-elections in 11 states of the federation. In a statement issued by the National Commissioner and Chairman of Information and Voter Education, Mr. Festus Okoye, the commission said it is not oblivious of the current mood of the country-the security situation, natural disasters and other emergencies reported in some parts of the country. Indeed, Okoye said the commission has been monitoring these situations regarding their possible impact on the smooth conduct of the bye-elections. Consequently, he said: “The Commission will on October 22, 2020, hold a meeting with the 37 RECs to evaluate the situation in the states and constituencies where bye-elections have been scheduled. “The outcome will be communicated to the public immediately after the meeting.” According to the statement, the public would recall that the INEC had scheduled the conduct of bye-elections in 15 constituencies in 11 states for October 31, 2020. The elections, Okoye explained are consisted of six senatorial and nine state House of Assembly seats, adding that the vacancies were as a result of deaths and resignation of previous members. The commission, he said, had been engaged in meticulous preparations for the by-elections for several weeks in its determination to continue to deliver free, fair, credible and safe elections for Nigerians.
