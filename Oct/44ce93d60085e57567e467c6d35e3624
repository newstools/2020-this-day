The Enugu Electricity Distribution Plc (EEDC) said it plan to migrate customers to enjoy improved and better services. It explained that the exercise would affect
customers served by 40 feeders spread across Abia, Anambra, Enugu and Imo States; with Abia and Imo States accounting for 72.5 per cent. A statement quoted the Head of Corporate Communications, EEDC, Mr. Emeka Ezeh. According to Ezeh, “the various investments made by EEDC on its network have continued to yield positive results, as customers served by these affected Feeders will begin to enjoy guaranteed daily supply above 13 hours from November this year.” With this development, customers are expected to support EEDC by promptly paying their bills to enable the company sustain this standard and make more investment in its network, translating to improved service delivery. “Customers are therefore urged to desist from acts capable of undermining these positive efforts embarked on by EEDC,” Ezeh further stated. The EEDC stated that it has been investing in its network, with a view to upgrading and strengthening it to deliver better service to its customers; and effort is on to migrate more customers across the network, to enjoy improved services. “There is no doubt that the customers migrated will begin to spend less on alternative power, as the resources used in maintaining and running their generator sets will be used to take care of other needs. “EEDC remains committed to delivering on its promise of providing improved services to her esteemed customers, but counts on their support to actualize this”, Ezeh assured.
