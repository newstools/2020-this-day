By John Shiklam The Kaduna State Government has relaxed the 24-hour curfew imposed on the state last Saturday following the looting of COVID-19 palliatives from warehouses in the state. However, the 24 hour curfew is to be sustained in Chikun and Kaduna South Local Government Areas of the state. Hundreds of youths last Saturday broke into an unoccupied residential house at Gwari Avenue in Barnawa, Kaduna South LGA as well as a NAFDAC store in Narayi, Chikun LGA, also in the metropolis, looting and vandalising private businesses and homes. In a statement issued yesterday, the state Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, said security agencies recommended for “a significant relaxation of the curfew in 21 local government areas. “However, the 24-hour curfew will continue in Chikun and Kaduna South LGAs until further notice. “From October 27, 2020, residents can pursue their lawful business between 6a.m. and 4p.m. daily. “Curfew hours will be from 4p.m. to 6a.m. in all local government areas except Chikun and Kaduna South.” He added that: “As the security assessment noted, criminal attempts to violate lives and property persist in the two local government areas. “Therefore, the 24-hour curfew remains in place in Chikun and Kaduna South Local Government Areas.” Aruwan said: “Residents of these two local government areas are advised to remain in their homes as efforts to normalise the situation continue. “Markets, offices and commercial centres, hotels and recreation centres in the two LGAs are to remain closed during the 24-hour curfew. “Social and mass gatherings are also prohibited in these areas until further notice. “As essential services, hospitals and medical facilities are expected to open and offer services during this period.”
