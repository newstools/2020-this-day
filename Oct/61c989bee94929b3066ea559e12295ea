Determined to address the power supply challenge in Bara community in Obafemi Owode local government area Ogun State, the International Breweries Plc has inaugurated an electrification project involving a 300KVA ONAN oil-immersed step-down transformer and 415 V overhead distribution line to the community. The rural electrification project which is expected to have a positive multiplier impact on the lives of more than 1,000 inhabitants of households in and around Bara, was declared ready for use in a commissioning and Covid-19 palliatives-donation ceremony attended by government officials, traditional rulers, company executives, journalists, community leaders, and representatives. Legal and Corporate Affairs Director, International Breweries, Temitope Oguntokun, said the N12.4 million electrification project was yet another testament of the company’s commitment to an effective and efficient corporate social responsibility to boost the economic fortunes of Bara community and environs. “Our dream of a better world drives our vision to support communities in Nigeria through our five CSR pillars of Empowerment, Education, Health, Infrastructural support, and Responsible drinking. “This dream led to the vision to support the Ogun State Government to provide this power intervention to Bara community and its environs. With today’s project, we are also demonstrating our contributions to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): Goal 7: Affordable and Clean Energy; Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities; SGD 3 – Good health and well-being; SDG 9: Industry, innovation & infrastructure,” she said. According to the Commissioner for Industry, Trade and Investment, Kikelomo Longe, who represented the Ogun State governor, “The decision to address the challenges faced by Bara community as well as the distribution of palliatives in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic is a laudable step which is in tandem with the CSR principles and the building our future together agenda of the Dapo Abiodun-led administration.”
