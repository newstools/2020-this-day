According to the statement, signed by the General Manager, Nairametrics Financial Advocates, Mr. Chris Pemu, “It has come to the attention of Nairametrics Financial Advocates, owners of Nairametrics.com that impostors and fraudulent individuals and organisations are impersonating themselves as Nairametrics and/or its Founder, Ugo Ugodre Obi-Chukwu, to extort money from innocent Nigerians online and on social media. “We therefore denounce this fraudulent and unscrupulous impersonation and hereby alert the general public to this urgent situation. For the avoidance of doubt, Ugodre Obi-Chukwu, Nairametrics and its employees do not accept money from anyone for investment and financial advisory services. “This is also clearly stated in our disclaimer notices.
