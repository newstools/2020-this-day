Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja The Director General of the Progressives Governors Forum (PGF), Dr. Salihu Lukeman has urged the President Muhammadu Buhari to overhaul the machinery of his administration to restore peace in the country. Lukeman said this in a statement issued in Abuja yesterday, which was titled “Save Nigeria for APC to Command Moral and Electoral Credibility, a Wakeup Call to all our Leaders”. According to him, a period of crisis is always the test of leadership, stressing that the fact that Nigeria is in a crisis was not in dispute because it was already consuming precious lives of Nigerians. He also noted that property and assets of citizens and government were being destroyed. Lukeman however, said, “unfortunately, responses from our political leaders especially at federal level are below public expectation..” He said “If all the agencies of government and political appointees managing these agencies have handled their responsibilities as is expected, this crisis would have been averted. “In fact, the pressure on President Muhammadu Buhari’s direct intervention will not have been the case. The crisis produced by the #EndSARS protest highlight the need for the President to urgently take steps to overhaul the machinery of government if our democracy and our government is to be able to meet the expectation of citizens. “It is the constitutional prerogative of the President to determine the best strategy and the details of governmental reforms aimed at overhauling the machinery of government to make them more effective in responding to the democratic needs of Nigerians.“ The PGF DG also said it was important for the Buhari and Nigerian leaders especially those in the All Progressives Congress (APC) to set aside their differences and rise up to the occasion and hasten intervention through appropriate civic engagement across every part of the country to ensure restoration of peace in the country.
