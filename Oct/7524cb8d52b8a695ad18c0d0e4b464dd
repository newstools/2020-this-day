Tottenham Hotspur manager Jose Mourinho believes there could be only one reason why long-term rival Arsene Wenger missed out on mentioning him in his new book. “Because he never beat me,” Mourinho told reporters yesterday.
Wenger’s autobiography — “My Life in Red and White” — looks back over his 22 years in charge of Arsenal between 1996 and 2018. But there was no mention of his touchline duels with Mourinho, whose Chelsea side dethroned the Frenchman’s Invincibles in 2004/2005. The rivalry came to a head in 2014 when they physically clashed on the touchline during an English Premier League (EPL) meeting at Stamford Bridge. It took Wenger 14 attempts to beat the Portuguese coach who once branded him a “specialist in failure”, and in the end could only muster two wins in 19 matches. “You are not going to do a chapter about 12 or 14 matches and never win one. So, why should he speak about me in his book? A book is a thing to make you happy, make you proud. So, I perfectly understand the situation,” said Mourinho.
