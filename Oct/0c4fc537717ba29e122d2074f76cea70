From Wole Ayodele in Jalingo No fewer than six people including a youth Corps member died in a stampede as hoodlums vandalise government warehouses in Jalingo. Besides government warehouses at FGGC road, TSTC park and THU road, other warehouses and businesses belonging to private individuals were also vandalised by the hoodlums. Though the deputy governor of the state, Alhaji Haruna Manu had announced the imposition of curfew in Jalingo beginning from 11.00pm on Saturday to 8.00am on Monday, the curfew order was defied as the hoodlums stormed the NYSC camp along Wukari road where mattresses, chairs, deep freezers and other items were carted. Also, Yaggai Schools, owned by former deputy and acting governor of the state, Alhaji Sani Abubakar Danladi as well as Red Star group of schools owned by Chief Uche Obi were vandalised by the hoodlums among other private business outfits. At the warehouse situated at TSTC park, Keke Napep, generators, water pumping machines, exquisite doors were among the items carted away by the hoodlums. Crusader gathered that some of the hoodlums sold a Keke Napep just outside the warehouse at the sum of fifty thousand (N50,000) naira while a carton of indomie was being sold for one thousand (N1,000) naira only. An attempt by the hoodlums to vandalise the ICT centre of the Taraba State University was foiled by the arrival of security agents who shot sporadically into the air to disperse the hoodlums. The late Corp member, whose identify is yet to be released by the NYSC authorities, was said to be on terminal leave when he lost his life in the stampede. Meanwhile, several churches conducted their Sunday service while people went about their businesses in despite the curfew imposed on the state capital by the state government.
