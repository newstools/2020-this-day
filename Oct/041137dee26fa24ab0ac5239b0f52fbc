Deji Elumoye in Abuja The Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, has revealed that the federal government will soon commence a major rehabilitation work on the deplorable Warri-Benin highway. Omo-Agege, in a release on Saturday, attributed the latest government move to the outcome of a recent interface he had with the Minister of Works and Housing, Mr Babatunde Fashola over the bad condition of the expressway. He said: “Following constructive and fruitful engagements between the Deputy President of the Senate (DSP), Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, and the Minister for Works, Mr. Babatunde Fashola (SAN), on the deplorable state of the Warri-Benin expressway and its debilitating effects on our people and businesses operating in large parts of the Niger Delta, the Federal Ministry of Works is now finalising preparations to undertake major works on this very important national corridor.” He commended the Minister’s responsiveness, understanding and assurances “on the need to urgently overcome the obvious and very serious challenges that the present state of the road poses to citizens, businesses, security and by implication, the national economy”. The ranking Senator also appreciated the road users for their continuing patience amid the hardships arising from the poor state of the road adding that the federal government and other stakeholders will continue to work diligently together to ensure that work on the road is done unhindered and properly. “I feel the pains of the Warri-Benin highway users and humbly appeal to our people for more patience, as I will be constantly guided by their best interests and the greater good of the nation” Omo-Agege said.
