Energy Management Specialist, Schneider Electric has restated its commitment to improving its employees in terms of skills-building and knowledge-expansion. The General Manager, Process Automation of Schneider Electric (West Africa), Ajibola Akindele, stated that boosting the capacity of staff would also help build local content and create multiplier effects whereby those trained would be able to train others and provide technical services to other African countries. “We continue to expose our staff to foreign training and they return to train others back in Nigeria and service other African countries, such as Ghana, Kenya, Cote d’ Ivoire and Uganda,” he said. Akindele noted that as part of the organisation’s efforts to boost capacity, it commissioned a JAMB exam centre in Bonny Kingdom for youths on the island while also deploying subsidised training programmes in electrical and solar energy for Nigerian youth to boost local competencies. He said that asides capacity building, the company, in its over 20 years of operations, has supported Nigeria’s power and oil sector through ground-breaking technologies to improve power supply and operation efficiency in the oil and gas sector. He said: “We have over the years, supplied power and control processes equipment and critical infrastructure to support oil and gas industry operations, whether for LNG plants or FPSOs. “Some of Schneider Electric’s offerings to the oil industry included control systems, SCADA, cyber security, software optimisation, asset performance and AI. Our activities also cover downstream operations like refineries’ solutions on controls and safety.”
