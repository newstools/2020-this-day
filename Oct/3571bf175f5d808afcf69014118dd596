Oluwabunmi Fache The Chief Information Officer of MyKab, Mr Kolade Adebimpe, has said that MyKab has come to change the standard in the e-hailing sector for easy movement in Lagos State. He explained that MyKab is an indigenous developed ridesharing application that meets the need of partners, drivers and riders, adding that the status quo of
transportation and ride –hailing in Lagos state is unacceptable to the people. “Logicians spend 75 per cent of weekly working hours in traffic, hence, the development of the MyKab application will help overpass the gap and provide for easy
navigation in the state”, he said. MyKab has set up several vehicle assessment centres in the state which will serve as test facilities to ensure all MyKab vehicles are roadworthy at all times. Adebimpe further said that the app company is focused on five main values which include security, compliance, partnership, customers’ service and value for money “It is noteworthy to say that at MyKab, we continue to operate towards the future. We will always optimise for the delight and joy of our esteemed riders and drivers. “We are very much confident that our continued success will be hinged upon our strongly built mobile applications (available on 105 and google) and our amazing customers’ success team.
