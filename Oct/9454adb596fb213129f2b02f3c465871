Langtang North Local Government Chairman, Ubandoma Laven, has lamented that the council is cut off from the happenings in the state due to its remote location from the state capital. Speaking to journalists recently in Jos, the state capital, Laven said the dire situation informed his establishment of a radio station, Star FM, in Langtang to give his people a sense of belonging, and to ensure that they don’t depend on hearsay.
The council chairman further stressed that information was vital, adding that for such an old local government in the state, it has been unfortunate that the council is cut off from first-hand information. “It seems like a dungeon situation. But I thank God; I have been able to build a Radio station, Star FM, Langtang which commences operation any moment from now,” he stated.
He revealed the council’s intention to employ experience hands in running of radio stations. Laven further explained that though it’s a community-based station, the running would be handled by consultants that understand the rudiments of radio stations in order to derive maximum professional services. According to him: “With the station, the people including the youths and children will be more educated. Local advert on the station will help generate some revenue too. Locals will be employed to do one or two jobs in the station. Enlightenment on issues such as COVID-19 will be better. It will generally change the orientation of the people. “Aside from the station, my one year in office has seen several other developmental projects. I have drilled about 26 hand-driven and motorised boreholes; I have restored peace in my council by organising arms-recovery programmes in the council, with youths voluntarily submitting their arms; I procured two heavy duty lorries to boost our IGR and two modern tractors to assist farmers in agriculture; and I bought two taskforce buses for revenue generation. So, IGR has seriously been improved upon.”
