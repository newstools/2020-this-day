President Muhammadu Buhari has said that some people misconstrued the promptness with which he acted to accede to the 5-point demand of the youths as a sign of weakness. He said this in his national broadcast to the nation over the violence ravaging several states following the shooting of peaceful protesters by soldiers at the Lekki Toll gate on Tuesday night. Buhari therefore called on the youths to leave the streets and take advantage of the various programmes of his government to make their lives better. He added that their voices had been heard loud and clear.
