By Onyebuchi Ezigbo The Nigerian Inter Religious Council (NIREC) has asked the Federal Government to immediately take measures to bring a quick and peaceful resolution to the current wave of protests by Nigerian youths over alleged bad governance and police brutality. The council also warned that soldiers and other security personnel should not go after peaceful protesters, but those who are attacking innocent people and destroying properties. The Executive Secretary of NIREC, Rev. Fr. Cornelius Omonokhua, who addressed a press conference yesterday in Abuja, urged the Nigerian youths to calm down on the protest and give the government time to respond to their demands. According to the cleric, “NIREC, under the leadership of the Co-chairmen, President of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), His Eminence Rev. Samson Olasupo Ayokunle, and the Sultan of Sokoto and the President-General of Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs, His Eminence Alhaji Muhammadu Sa’ad Abubakar, has noticed with concern the current waves of protest happening around the country. “If not addressed, such protest as peaceful as they are intended, could be manipulated by unscrupulous elements in the society, thus resulting in the breakdown of law and order.” Omonokhua said NIREC is urging the federal government to swing into action and bring a quick and peaceful resolution to the situation on ground. In the same vein, NIREC urged the Nigerian youths to calm down on the protest and give the government time to respond to their demands, adding: “NIREC also appeal to all Nigerian citizens to remain calm and remain law abiding.”
