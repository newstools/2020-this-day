By Udora Orizu Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has described as falsehood the insinuations peddled in some quarters that the country has been wasting resources and that nothing has been achieved in the area of constitutional amendment. Osinbajo stated this on Thursday while delivering his goodwill message at the inauguration of the special adhoc committee on the review of the 1999 constitution. Represented by the Secretary to the government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, the Vice President opined that President Muhammadu Buhari evidently remains the President who signed the most constitutional alteration Acts since the advent of constitutional democracy in 1999, including the Not Too Young to Run Bill that reduced the age a person must attain to contest elections and the Acts that granted financial autonomy to the judiciary and the legislature. Osinbajo while restating that the constitution is a work in progress, urged the Committee not to discountenance any constitutional alteration proposal, no matter how idealistic but to look at ways to galvanize them to improve our economy, create jobs, guarantee our safety and security and abolish corruption. He assured that the executive will give complete cooperation to the Committee by giving appropriate suggestions, recommendations and finally give assent at the end of the process. He said, ”My presence here underscores the importance this administration attaches to the review of the Constitution to be able to address our societal ills and propel the nation towards greatness. Looking at its leadership, membership composition and the expertise at its disposal, it is my firm conviction that the Committee will discharge its mandate excellently by liaising with relevant government agencies, civil society organizations, multi-lateral and supranational agencies and bodies to achieve a wholesome amendment to the Nigerian constitution. ”This administration places a high premium on a harmonious working relationship with the legislature. We are at the implementation stage of the
Communique issued at the end of the recent two-day Executive-Legislature parley presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari which had as its theme, ‘‘Promoting Effective Executive Legislative Partnership, finding a Middle Ground”.
