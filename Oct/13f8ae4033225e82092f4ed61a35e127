She further noted with dismay that the company has displayed a flagrant disregard for compliance with global standards necessary to assure the production
of quality assured products, which was why the company has been blacklisted accordingly. She also warned all manufacturers and importers of medicines to adhere strictly to the conditions for which their products were registered by NAFDAC or face similar sanctions.
