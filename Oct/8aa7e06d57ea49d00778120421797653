When in Rome you drink your coffee standing up. When in Melbourne you drink your coffee sitting down but we havenâ€™t been able to for almost six months due to coffee restrictions. Now Rome has closed down and Melbourne has opened up. The first day was amazing for the number of people sitting down for coffee, and breakfast and then heading to that Hardware Store. We all know that the restrictions and facemasks are necessary, except maybe one narcissist in America, but we look forward to the day when the world is safe and we can do whatever we want to, no matter how trivial it is.
