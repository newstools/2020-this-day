As part of its commitment to deepen its relationship with key stakeholders in the advertising industry, the Registrar/Chief Executive of Advertising Practitioners Council of Nigeria (APCON), Dr. Olalekan Fadolapo, has made a courtesy call on the Director General, Kano State Urban Beautification and Landscaping Agency, Alhaji Abdallah T. Ahmed. The APCON Registrar said his visit was to explore areas of common interest for greater synergy between the two regulatory agencies. He stated that the primary responsibility of APCON was to ensure that advertising comply with global best practices and ethical standards in order to resolve common challenges bedeviling the sector. “We seek effective collaboration and partnership with all stakeholders for the establishment of sound ethics and professionalism in the Integrated Marketing Communications Industry,” he added. He pledged APCON’s commitment to collaborate with KSUBLA in order to harmonise all areas of mutual interests to guard against unethical practice. “It is pertinent to point out that this bold initiative if taken seriously, will in no small measure, create an avenue to generate more revenue for the state,” Fadolapo said. Responding, Ahmed congratulated Fadolapo on his appointment. He expressed appreciation to the Registrar for making out time to pay the state agency a visit. He assured the APCON team of his commitment and support to work closely and assiduously to sanitize the business of Advertising in the State by getting rid of charlatans. “It is our desire to continue working to strengthen the partnership between APCON and our Agency. For this reason, we have planned a general enforcement on all illegal structures and will ensure that, going forward, those who are not APCON certified will not be allowed to practice advertising in the State,” the DG stated.
