Whatever is used as measurement of success would see the Executive Chairman of AMAC Area Council, Abuja, Alhaji Abdullahi Candido, coming out triumphant. His concrete achievements have been observed and analyzed with statistical data. Candido has performed beyond the expectation and imagination of the masses. He has managed the little resources effectively by providing the basic necessity of life to the people of AMAC Area Council. He has also given hope to the hopeless by donating text books, exercise books, mathematical sets and other essential items to students of the council. Many roads in the AMAC Area Council were not motorable before Candido assumed office as executive chairman, but he put smiles on the faces of the road users by constructing roads, building schools equipped with computer in furtherance of the reality that the world is a global village. He also built health care centres for the masses, recreation centres and free uniforms for students in the area. He did not leave any stone unturned in the area of security, providing the people with a new lease of life after years of living in fear. He also provided jobs for the youth in the area, purchased both GCE and NECO forms for the students, built modern markets at affordable prices for market women and men in the council. Candido has proven a capability to do everything humanly possible to help the needy and the destitute, even at his own detriment. His vision and mission could be compared to the best in the land, from south to north. It will be difficult for any chairman to surpass Candidoâ€™s achievements and performances in the AMAC Area Council. Without doubt, he deserves to contest for a bigger office in 2023.
