Czech coach Jaroslav Silhavy will once again miss his team’s Nations League clash with Scotland as he has tested positive for Covid-19, the Czech FA said on Monday. “Unfortunately, the trip to Scotland will not concern… one player and head coach Jaroslav Silhavy, who have tested positive,” the FA said in a statement. It added the rest of the team would travel to Scotland on Tuesday. The game at Hampden is due on Wednesday evening. Silhavy, who has no symptoms of the disease, already missed the Czech Republic’s home clash with Scotland in early September over a virus scare. The Czechs lost 2-1 after calling up a reserve squad comprising 21 newcomers as their entire first-choice squad and coaching staff had been released following two positive tests among the team staff. Scotland, who lead the League B Group 2 a point ahead of the Czechs, will be looking to extend their unbeaten run to seven games after having beaten Slovakia 1-0 on Sunday. The Czechs beat Israel 2-1 at Haifa on Sunday. Also yesterday, the Premier League said that five people had returned positive results in its latest round of Covid-19 tests conducted on players and staff last week. The league said the individuals who had tested positive for the virus would now self-isolate for 10 days. “The Premier League can today (Monday) confirm that between Monday 5 October and Sunday 11 October, 1 128 players and club staff were tested for Covid-19. Of these, there were five new positive tests,” the Premier League said in a statement. A total of 34 people have tested positive for the novel coronavirus in six rounds of testing since the new campaign began on September 12.
