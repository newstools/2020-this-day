“… because they want to take care of certain little tiny fish that aren’t doing very well without water…” President Trump (Oct 9) Science is hurting when comments like this are made. Fish are found in water, they like water, they need water and fish, big, small and even very tiny die when they are removed from water, generally very quickly. Trump is wasting the oxygen he is using and if he talks to a scientist, he may find out that oxygen is quite popular with Californians too and everyone else as well. In fact, if he talks to a number of scientists, he may find out quite a few things like “Don’t be afraid of COVID” are wrong. Do be afraid of COVID, it’s killed more people (over 200,000), than guns so far this year (almost 33,000). Pray for a vaccine for COVID and pray for the Science that will develop it.
