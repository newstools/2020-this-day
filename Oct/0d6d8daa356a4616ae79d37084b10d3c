By Vanessa Obioha Sean Connery, the Scottish actor who was the first to embody the iconic fictional character of the novelist Ian Fleming’s suave and resourceful secret agent James Bond, has passed away. His death was announced by Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon on Twitter. “I was heartbroken to learn this morning of the passing of Sir Sean Connery. Our nation today mourns one of her best loved sons.” During his time with the franchise, Connery played James Bond seven times before he left. His first role was in ‘Dr. No’ in 1962. “Sean was born into a working class Edinburgh family and through talent & sheer hard work, became an international film icon and one of the world’s most accomplished actors,” wrote Sturgeon. While describing Connery as a patriotic Scot, Sturgeon disclosed that he noticed the actor’s health was frail the last time they spoke. “It was a privilege to have known Sean. When I last spoke to him it was clear even then that his health was failing – but the voice, the spirit and the passion that we all loved so well were still there. I will miss him. Scotland will miss him. The world will miss him.” The actor was aged 90.
