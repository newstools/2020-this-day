Chuks Okocha in Abuja The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday directed that all its political and electioneering activities be put on hold as a further mark of honour for Nigerian youths who were killed at the Lekki Toll Gate as well as other killings that have occurred in various parts of the country over the unfortunate fall-out of the EndSARS peaceful protest. The PDP had earlier on Thursday night directed that its flags in all its offices nationwide be flown at half-mast in solidarity with the mood of the nation at this trying time. Also the party said that it is aware of the decision of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to postpone the pending bye-elections in six senatorial districts and nine state constituencies in 11 states of the federation, earlier scheduled for October 31, due to the crisis situation in the country. According to a statement by the National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, the PDP said that though such comes at high cost to candidates and political parties, but added, ” we hold that it is a step in the right direction under the prevailing circumstance.” In that regard, the PDP charged INEC to continue to monitor the situation and use the period to fine-tune its preparations to conduct peaceful, free, fair and credible elections as part of the much-needed panacea for the restiveness in the country. Furthermore, the party urges the security agencies to also use the period to perfect their roles in electoral operations and tidy up all arrangements to guarantee the right atmosphere for peaceful and transparent polls where the safety of the voters as well as the sanctity of the ballot box are guaranteed. The PDP also restated its call for calm and prayers for the nation at this critical time in the national life, even as all hands must be on the deck in finding solutions and the way forward for the nation.
