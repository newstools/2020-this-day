Airtel Africa is expanding its strategic partnership with Ericsson to enable 4G coverage in Kenya. With Ericsson’s Radio Access Network (RAN) and packet core products for 4G, Airtel subscribers will experience enhanced quality of voice and data. The network modernisation deal, signed in August 2020, is in line with the Kenyan Digital Economy Blueprint Vision 2030, which aims to provide robust connectivity in rural areas and facilitate e-commerce platforms. The deal will drive the simplification and upgrade of the existing network and future-proof it for the anticipated rapid mobile expansion in the country. With Ericsson Radio System and Packet Core solutions, Airtel Kenya’s network will have 4G coverage, while driving enhanced use cases in both the consumer and the enterprise segments. Ericsson technology shall make the network in Kenya ready for 5G deployment. CEO at Airtel Kenya, Prasanta Das Sarma, said: “Robust and secure communications are an essential component of a digital society in Kenya. We are firmly anchored to the strategy of delivering reliable connections across the country and are looking forward to expanding the high-quality mobile broadband services to our subscribers.” President of Ericsson Middle East and Africa, Fadi Pharaon, said: “Together with Airtel, we will implement this project that aims to establish an advanced LTE network in Kenya, providing Airtel’s customers an enriched experience – both in the consumer and business segments. Through this partnership, we reaffirm our ambition to set #AfricaInMotion by partnering with Airtel to grow and support an increasingly digitalised society in Kenya.”
