By Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed sadness over the gruesome vehicle accident in Mgbowu, Awgu Local Government Area of Enugu State, in which scores of people died, most of them school pupils. The Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, in a statement issued Friday, said the President condoled with families and kith and kin of the dead, while praying that God would grant them succour, and spare the country of such tragedy in future. The President also commiserated with the Catholic Church of Awgu, which runs Presentation Nursery and Primary School that the pupils attended, and the Enugu State government. He enjoined vehicle owners to ensure roadworthiness, as initial reports attributed the accident to brake-failure by the truck involved.
