Games can be moved to a neutral country if virus cases or travel restrictions prevent the home team from hosting or the away team from travelling to the original venue. Home fans can attend games at up to 30 per cent of a stadium’s capacity with approval from domestic public authorities, UEFA said. No tickets will go to the away teams.
