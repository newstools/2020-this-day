By Ernest Chinwo in Port Harcourt The #EndSARS protest continued in Port Harcourt on Saturday with the protesters demanding an end to police brutality and compensation for victims. The youths had on Friday night held a candle light procession in honour of dead victims of SARS/police brutality. Addressing journalists during the Saturday march, a Port Harcourt-based comedian, K.O Baba, said the procession was in honour of Chima Ikwunado, a mechanic who was allegedly tortured to death in the detention of the Eagle Crack unit of the Police at the Mile 1 Police Station, Diobu in Port Harcourt, Rivers State. He said it was also to honour Daniel Ikeaguchi, a musician that was shot dead recently at Elelenwo in Port Harcourt metropolis by a policeman attached to a supermarket while he was being chased by operatives of the anti-cultism unit of the police. Saturdayâ€™s protest was however unique as the protesters chanted prayers as they walked and sang praises to God. The more than one hundred youths gathered at the popular Garrison Junction, Aba Road at about 8am marched through UTC junction on Azikiwe Road en route Government House. As they marched, more youths were spotted alighting from vehicles and joining the procession. The protest also caused traffic congestion along the route as private and commercial vehicles stopped to give way to the protesters.
