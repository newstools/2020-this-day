By David-Chyddy Eleke A group, Global Movement for Igbo President 2023 (GLOMIP 2023) has been launched in Awka, Anambra State to help people of the South-east to produce the next president of the country. Leader of the group, Mr. Kennedy Iyere, a UK-based businessman who spoke during the inauguration of the group, said Nigeria needs the touch of an Igbo man to return to the path of greatness. Iyere said: “We have seen the best that the north can offer; we have seen the best the West can offer and we have seen the best the South-south can offer. This is the time to try the South-east. “This movement for Nigeria President of Igbo extraction will be a global project, which will be presented to the British and European Union parliaments as well as government agencies of the world. “It will be funded internationally, and the idea is that presidential candidate that will emerge from this platform will not spend his money to campaign, because if he does that he will be forced to recoup thereby leaving Nigeria worse than he met it.” Political politicians from Igboland including; Senator Ben Obi, former Anambra State governor, Chief Chukwuemeka Ezeife; former Aviation minister, Mrs Kema Chikwe, former minister of women affairs, Mrs Josephine Anennih and many others expressed optimism about the realisation of the project. Senator Obi said “Ndigbo cannot elect President all alone, rather, they should intensify fierce and deliberate lobbying of the North-west, North-east, North-central, South-west and South-south. “After reaching out to other zones, the next hurdle would be the political parties that have the constitutional right to sponsor people for elections. “For the Igbo presidency to be realised come 2023, the two major political parties, that is the ruling All Progressives Congress and the main opposition party, the Peoples Democratic Party, must zone their presidential tickets to the South-east zone to allow Nigerians choose whoever they want”.
