The Inspector General of Police (IG), Mohammed Adamu, Friday stated that the Nigeria police have arrested 53 suspects in connection with the looting of the FCT National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) orientation camp on October 27, 2020. In a statement by the Force Director, Press and Public Relations, Adenike Adeyemi, the IG made the assertion while inspecting the facility at Kubwa-Abuja. According to the statement, “A total number of fifty-three suspects have been arrested and will be charged to court.” He assured Nigerians that all those involved in the attack will be brought to justice as he appealed to members of the public to report anyone seen with any NYSC property that was looted. “For those that broke into this facility and stole, we assure Nigerians that we shall pursue them, track them and prosecute them,” Adamu said. The Director-General, NYSC, Brig. Gen. Shuaibu Ibrahim, on his part, appealed to members of the public to stop any attack on its orientation camps, as there are no palliatives in any of its camps. “People think that NYSC camps have palliatives and l want to tell Nigerians that we don’t have palliatives in our camps. “What is happening around the camps across the country are preparations towards opening of orientation camps by November 10th 2020. “We are preparing for resumption of orientation programme on November 10, and l want to use this opportunity to appeal to hoodlums to stop the attack on our facilities,” Ibrahim said.
