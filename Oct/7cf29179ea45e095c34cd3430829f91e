Cement brand and product offerings as well as a nod to the excellent

entered into strategic alliances for the supply of Liquefied Natural

mining operations. Given these deliberate and strategic choices
amongst other cost management efforts, we continue to combine
development and innovation into our offerings and activities,” Binji

are quite optimistic about the future because it affords us not only
with the opportunity to further evolve our business model but also
provides an opportunity for accelerated development. We will continue
to push to new markets aided by a focused distribution strategy.” Meanwhile, the stock market surged further as the Nigerian Stock
