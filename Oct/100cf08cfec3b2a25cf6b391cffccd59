The Chief Executive Officer of Mobihealth International, a telemedicine and digital healthcare platform, Funmi Adewara, has been named the winner of the 2020 edition of the global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at the 75th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) held in New York recently. The recognition, according to Mobihealth International, was an acknowledgment of her outstanding work at the firm. The competition endowed by the World Bank Group and its partners, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), UN Women and the Wharton School Zicklin Centre, showcases women entrepreneurs who support the global SDGs through their business operations, according to the Director, Partnerships and Practice Groups (External and Corporate Relations) of the World Bank, Jill Wilkins. Wilkins was quoted in a statement to have said: “The competition provides an opportunity to showcase women-led businesses that are not only supporting goals in health, food security, education, climate change, gender equality and industry, but also demonstrating resilience as they respond to the challenges of COVID-19.” Receiving the award, Adewara expressed her joy at the recognition and thanked the organisers of the competition for finding her worthy of the coveted prize.
