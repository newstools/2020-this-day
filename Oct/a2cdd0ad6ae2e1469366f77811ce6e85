Edinson Cavani will have to wait to make his Manchester United debut as he will miss the upcoming Newcastle clash due to an obligatory 14-day quarantine period. Restrictions mean that he will need to stay self-isolated for two weeks after making his transfer deadline day move to Old Trafford, which will mean he will not be available for selection for the Red Devils’ fourth Premier League game of the season. A trip to St. James’ Park on 17 October therefore will be out of the question. According to the UK’s Daily Mail, this also means his debut could come just four days later, when United fly across the channel to take on his former club Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League group stages. Cavani is the all-time leading goalscorer in Les Parisiens’ history with 200 goals, but has been without a club since his contract finished at the end of PSG’s European campaign in August – leaving him free to move to a new club. This was a proposition United didn’t turn down, signing him up on a one-year deal with the option of a second and handing him the legendary number seven shirt – one that has admittedly been something of a curse in recent years. The 33-year-old is fully aware of the need to quarantine, having tested positive for COVID-19 earlier in the year. It was a period of reflection for the striker, who even admitted he considered retiring at the time. He said: “Of course, I thought about quitting football. It is true I considered that option and the possibility of stopping playing and dedicating myself to life in the countryside.” Opting against the decision, he will now be tasked with climbing United back up the Premier League table after an indifferent start to the season, one which has seen them gain only four points from their opening three Premier League matches.
