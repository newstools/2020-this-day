By Segun James After three day of destruction of public and private property by hoodlums in the state, the Governor of Lagos, Babajide Sanwo-Olu took a tour parts of the city affected by the breakdown of law and order in the wake of Tuesday nightâ€™s shooting of unarmed #EndSARS protesters at the Lekki Toll Plaza by soldiers. The Governor was at the Ajeromi Ifelodun Local Government Secretariat, where he saw several cars in the expansive premises of the LGA that were either burnt or damaged. All the buildings within the premises, including an old generation bank building located in the compound, were also destroyed. He then moved to the adjourning police station where he also saw massive destruction. A number of people he met at the station lamented that they were sons and daughters of police officers and wondered why their parents should be singled out by the hoodlums when they were simply performing their lawful duties. A particular woman, virtually crying, complained that they could not be given decent education because their parents were poorly paid and appealed to Sanwo-Olu to see to the welfare of policemen and women. The governor then left the LGA Secretariat to visit some other spots in the area that suffered extensive damage.
