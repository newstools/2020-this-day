By Adedayo Akinwale President Muhammadu Buhari has assured that the operatives of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) responsible for misconduct or wrongful acts would be brought to justice. He said that disbanding SARS was the first step to extensive police reforms by his administration. The President disclosed this Monday at the launch of the Presidential Youth Empowerment Scheme (P-YES), aimed at creating 774,000 jobs across the Local Government Areas (LGAs) in the country, which was attended by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Senate President Ahmed Lawan, Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State and Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State. He said: ”I will like to use this opportunity to say a word on the recent genuine concerns and agitations by Nigerians about the excessive use of force and in some cases extra-judicial killings and wrongful conduct of the men of the Nigerian Police Force. ”The disbanding of SARS is only the first step in our commitment to extensive police reforms in order to ensure that the primary duty of the police and other law enforcement agencies remains the protection of lives and livelihood of our people. ”We will also ensure that all those responsible for misconduct or wrongful acts are brought to justice. We deeply regret the loss of life of the young man in Oyo State during the recent demonstrations. ”I have directed that the circumstances of his death should be thoroughly investigated. The few bad eggs should not be allowed to tarnish the image and reputation of the force.” The President however stressed that it was important to recognise that the vast majority of men and women of the police force are hardworking and diligent in performing their duties. The Inspector General of Police had on Sunday announced the dissolution of the special police squad on anti robbery following days of nationwide protests against brutality and other misconducts of operatives of the police unit.
