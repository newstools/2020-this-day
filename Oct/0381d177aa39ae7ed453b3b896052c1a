Benjamin Nworie in Abakaliki Ebonyi State Governor, Mr. David Umahi yesterday said he had not defected from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC). Umahi, also Chairman of South-east Governors Forum, noted that he “is still a member of the PDP contrary to media reports insinuating his defection to the ruling party.” A member of the House of Representatives from Ebonyi State, Hon. Chinedu Ogah had earlier claimed that the governor had defected to the APC. Ogah noted that as the leader of the APC in Ebonyi State he commended the governor for defecting to the Party. According to him, Umahi defected to the APC after meeting several leaders of the party including President Muhammadu Buhari. He described it as a bold step and a move in the right direction, even as he asked the governors of Abia, Enugu and Anambra to join the APC for stability in the polity and Southeast. “Yes, Umahi’s defection to our great party, APC is a step in the right direction. We cannot afford to remain in opposition. We must join the ruling party to continue to reap the dividends of democracy. “I am calling on other governors in the Southeast to toe the line of Governor Umahi and join APC. We have to be at the centre, we have to join mainstream politics for overall development of our zone and the country in general. “President Muhammadu Buhari has done well. Everybody should join the APC to encourage him”, Ogah said. But when contacted, Umahi simply said it “is not true. I am still in PDP.”
