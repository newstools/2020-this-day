By Deji Elumoye The Senate on Wednesday resolved to thoroughly investigate the recent extrajudicial killings across the country by operatives of the Police Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS). This was sequel to the adoption of a motion raised via Orders 42 and 52 of the Senate Rules by the Chairman of the Senate committee on Communications, Senator Oluremi Tinubu, who complained about the recent harassment and killing of her constituent in Lagos central senatorial district. The upper legislative chamber has therefore mandated its committees on judiciary, legal matters and police to investigate the various cases of extrajudicial killings in different parts of the country. The Senate expressed its readiness to get to the root of the matter with a pledge that the SARS officers involved in the killing of innocent Nigerians will face the full wrath of the law.
