Perhaps, time and chance also speak directly to this. But more importantly is the fact that the Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu has leadership imbued inside of him. Although his takeoff as governor was initially slow, he has never failed in delivering leadership, much as he has also kept a good pace with fixing Lagos. When the first index case of the Covid-19 pandemic was discovered in late February, not only did the whole country wait with baited breath, it soon marked a defining point in the life of the country. However, for the people of Lagos, Sanwo-Olu kept hope alive and soon, the rest of the country took a cue from him. It was not surprising, therefore, that since the start of the #ENDSARS protests, which are fast assuming a life of their own in many parts of the country, the governor has since risen to the challenge, communicating effectively with the youths and holding forth as much as he could. Suffice it to say this is far from being over, but Sanwo-Oluâ€™s approach to the situation has again relived hope and indeed, a proof of the fact that Lagos is lucky with its choice of governor, who beyond the brick and mortar often identified with governance, is delivering sound leadership. Kudos, Governor Sanwo-Olu!
