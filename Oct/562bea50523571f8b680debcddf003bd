The Anambra State Governor, Mr. Willie Obiano, yesterday raised the alarm that four out of the 21 local government areas in the state were under water due to the flood ravaging the state. Obiano disclosed this in an interview with State House correspondents after a meeting he had with President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. The governor said, “Four of my local governments, that is four out of 21, are under water now as we speak because of this flood and it affected a lot of things, which include farm produce and what have you. “So, I called on Mr. President to assist us at this very crucial time being a COVID-19 time. The flood we are experiencing this time is like 2012, which is terrible. “So, he promised to do something immediately.” When asked about the extent of damage caused by flood in the affected councils, Obiano said, “We have over 5,000 people displaced and we already prepared some receptacles where we received the displaced people. “I believe Mr. President will be able to assist us to be able to support these families that have been displaced in this manner.” Obiano said he also briefed the President on the progress of work on the second Niger Bridge. He said, “You will see that almost half of that bridge has been done. But because the water level is very high, the contractor working in that bridge requires some equipment which they have already purchased long ago sitting in Germany and requires some support from the central bank to be able to bring in the equipment.” “I did mention that to him and the President noted that and said he will do something about that.” The governor said he also raised the issue of the Federal University of Education in Aguleri with the President. He added, “The Anambra North senatorial district does not have any federal institution at all. “Other two senatorial districts have two or three federal institutions.”
