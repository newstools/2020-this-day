Femi Solaja with agency report Super Falcons’ Captain and reigning African Footballer of the Year, Asisat Oshoala and the rest of her Barcelona Femeni began their domestic league campaign on a bright note yesterday as they hammered Real Madrid’s women’s team 4-0 at home in the first ‘Clasico’ in the Primera Division. The Nigeria forward who was one of the top scorers for the defending champions was however not on scoring sheet as she came in for Jennifer Hermoso in the 72nd minute. She was part of the action that led to fourth goal of the match. Meanwhile, another Nigerian player, Chioma Ubogagu was unused player for Real Madrid as she sat all through and watched the away side pummel her teammates all through the maiden El Clasico. Barca who were crowned champions when last season ended prematurely due to the coronavirus pandemic, dominated play from the start in the match played at Ciudad Real Madrid ground and took the lead in the 18th minute with a deflected strike from the edge of the area by Patricia Guijarro. Madrid looked to have levelled when Sweden international Kosovare Asllani netted from close range after a spill from Barca goalkeeper Sandra Panos, but the goal was ruled out for a foul on the keeper amid angry protests from the home side. Barca extended their lead early in the second half when Madrid defender Babett Peter diverted the ball into her own net after goalkeeper Misa Rodriguez had parried a cross from Barca’s Norway international Caroline Graham Hansen. Graham Hansen was a handful for Madrid’s defence throughout and also set up the final two goals, a volley from former world player of the year Lieke Martens and a strike from Spain forward Alexia Putellas. Real were playing their first match since completing the process to absorb local side CD Tacon in July, having competed in the top flight last season under Tacon’s name and wearing their kit but training and playing at Real’s training ground.
