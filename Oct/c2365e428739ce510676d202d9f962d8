First Defendant counsel, Adisa Oluwole, brought to the attention of the court that the Defendants had been granted bail before retired Justice Olusola Williams, and would like to continue on the said bail. This view was also supported by the second defence counsel, Ali Aba, and third defence counsel, Tope Jimoku.
